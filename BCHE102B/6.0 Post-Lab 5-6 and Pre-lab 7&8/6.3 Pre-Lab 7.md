## Fatty Acid Oxidation Background

- ### Oxidation-reduction reaction (AKA redox reactions)
	- reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another
	- the species that loses electrons -> oxidized
	- species which gains electrons -> reduced
- ### Fatty Acid Oxidation

	- Omega-3 Fatty acids are particularly high in fish oils
	- fatty acids are also very susceptible to oxidation
	- oxidation causes a strong, rancid odor, as the fats are **converted into smaller molecules like ==aldehydes==**

	- the mitochondrial aerobic process of breaking down a fatty acid into acetyl-CoA units
	> Why store carbohydrates when you can store lipids which seems more efficient?
	> 	Carbohydrates are easier to transport (water soluble)
	> 	Also easier to process
	> 	some organs are specific that they want to start with carbohydrates

> Glycolysis -> splitting of glucose
> glucose ----Ten steps --> pyruvate -> Acetyl CoA -> TCA Cycle (Krebs Cycle) -> Oxidative phosphorylation (includes ETC - electron transport chain)
> 1 glucose gives us 38 ATP
	
> Fatty acids can be used to make pyruvate then pyruvate to glucose (Gluconeogenesis)
> 	gluconeogenesis -> making glucose from non carbohydrate sources
> 	Fatty acyl CoA oxidized to -> Acetyl CoA (like in Glycolysis)
> Fatty acid can also be directly oxidized to become Acetyl CoA to create NADH/FADH2 necessary for the electron transport chain
> Gluconeogenesis also needs to use ATP as well as Fatty Acid Oxidation
> Also produced 38 ATP but you've expended already some ATP
