	- 4 Groups within ABO System
		- Determined by presence or absence of Antigen A or Antigen B on RBC
		- Are:
			- #### A
				- Antigen A on RBC
				- Anti-B Antibodies
			- #### B
				- Antigen B on RBC
				- Anti-A Antibodies
			- #### AB
				- Both Antigen A and B on RBC
				- No Antibodies
			- #### O
				- Neitehr Antigen A And B on RBC
				- Anti-A And Anti-B Antibodies
				- Most common bloodtype in the world
	- To determine bloodtype, we use agglutination
		- clumping together to form a mass

- ### Agglutination Setup
	- Needs
		- Sample of Blood
		- Antiserum A (Containing Anti A Antibodies)
		- Antiserum B (Containing Anti B Antibodies)
	- Put Antiserum A in one side of glass slide and Antiserum B on other side
		- add blood to both. 
		- If Antiserum A agglutinates, it has A antigen. If it doesn't, it does not.
		- If Antiserum B agglutinates, it has B antigen. If it doesn't, it does not.
	- Agglutination on A only -> Blood Type A
	- Agglutination on B only -> Blood Type B
	- Agglutination on A and B -> Blood Type A B
	- No Agglutination on eitehr -> Blood Type O
