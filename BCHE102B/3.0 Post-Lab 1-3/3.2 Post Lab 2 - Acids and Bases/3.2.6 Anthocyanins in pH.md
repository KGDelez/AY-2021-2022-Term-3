- Anthocyanin molecules will change their color depending upon the pH of their environment thus it may serve as a pH indicator. Anthocyanins have a purple hue in neutral pH.The anthocyanin turns red-pink in acids (pH1-6), reddish-purple in neutral solutions(pH7) and green in alkaline or basic solutions(pH8-14)
