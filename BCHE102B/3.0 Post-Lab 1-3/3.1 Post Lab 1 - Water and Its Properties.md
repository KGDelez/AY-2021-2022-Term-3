## Water and Its Properties 
- ![[1.3.1 Water and its properties]]
### Key Terms
- Covalent Bond
	- chemical bond - two attoms connected by sharing of electrons
- Hyrdrogen bond
	- weak bond where H atom in one molecule is attracted to an electronegative atom (usually N or O) in the same or different molecule (intramolecular or intermolecular)
- Dipole
	- Oppositely charged at two points (or poles)
- Electronegativity
	- Tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons

- Why is water a polar molecule?
	- unequal sharing of electrons between O and H
	- Electrons are more pulled towards O

* polar substances dissolve polar substances and non-polar substances dissolve non-polar

- What is a hydrogen bond?
	- Can be Intramolecular or Intermolecular

### Water as a solvent
- Why is water a powerful solvent? ^f8bc82
- ![[Pasted image 20220520135340.png]]
- If NaCl is placed in water, it will dissociate into ionic components
- Certain salts are referred to in physio as electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium)
	- nervous impulses
	- muscle contraction
	- hydration 
	- regulation of PH levels

### Cohesion and Adhesion

^223610

- Cohesion - Tendency of water to stick together
- Adhesion - bonding of water molecules to other substances
- Capillary action - liquid to flow against gravity in narrow space
	- plants flowing water upward to leaves from rootes - continuous absorption of water from the ground
	- capillary action
	- evapotranspiration -

### Surface Tension
- high surface tension is caused by molecular interactions
- ![[Pasted image 20220520140304.png]]
- surface tension because bonds of top layer to the lower molecules. 

### High Specific Heat Capacity

^e3bcc2

- Both this and heat of vaporization means we don't boil in our bodies
- Heat Capaity - capability of substance to absorb heat energy
- Specific heat - measure of energy required to heat a substance one deg C
	- Water needs to absorb 4.184 J (missing)
### High Heat of Vaporization
- Heat of Vaporization
	- How much energy is required to turn liquid into gas
	- Water 

- Water evaporating
	- evaporative cooling
	- alcohol - you feel it immediately because it is faster to evaporate

- structure is related to function
