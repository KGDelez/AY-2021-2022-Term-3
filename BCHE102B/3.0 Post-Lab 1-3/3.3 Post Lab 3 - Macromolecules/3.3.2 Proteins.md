## Proteins
- The major building block of proteins are called Î±-amino acids
- They contain a carboxylic acid functional group and an amine functional group
- There are 20 amino acids
	- 12 nonessential
	- 8 essential

### Protein Structures

#### Primary Structure
- Amino acid sequences - chains of amino acids
#### Secondary Structure
- Folding of Primary structure into Alpha Helix or Beta Pleated 
#### Tertiary Structure
- Three dimensional shape of the folded amino acid chain (has both alpha helix and beta pleated)
- just one chain
#### Quarternary Structure
- Multiple chains - multiple tertiary structures together

### Protein Denaturation
- ![[Pasted image 20220526202923.png]]
- Destruction of one or more structures (primary, secondary, tertiary, or quarternary) of the protein.
- Structure and Function are correlated, so if a structure is destroyed it will not be able to do its function correctly
- Renaturation may happen in the body 
	- When proteins get denatured by heat for ex. If return to normal temps and with the help of maybe enzymes, they can renature

#### Causative Agents
| Denaturing Agent                                      | Mode of Action                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heat                                                  | Disrupts H bonds by making molecules vibrate too much. Causes coagulation like in the frying of an egg                             |
| Microwave radiation                                   | Same with Heat                                                                                                                     |
| Ultraviolet Radiation                                 | Very similar to heat (e.g. sunburn)                                                                                                |
| Violent Whipping or shaking                           | Causes molecules in globular shapes to extend to longer lengths. These then entangle (making meringue from egg white)              |
| Detergent                                             | Affects R-group interactions                                                                                                       |
| Organic Solvents (e.g. Ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone)  | Interferes with R-group interactions by also forming H bonds with the protein. This can denature protein in bacteria and kill them |
| Strong acids and bases                                | Disrupts H bonds and salt bridges- prolonged action leads to hydrolysis of peptide bonds                                           |
| Salts of heavy metals (e.g. salts of Hg2+, Ag+, Pb2+) | Metal ions combine with -SH and form poisonous salts                                                                               |
| Reducing Agents                                       | Reduces disulfide linkages to produce -SH groups                                                                                                                                   |
