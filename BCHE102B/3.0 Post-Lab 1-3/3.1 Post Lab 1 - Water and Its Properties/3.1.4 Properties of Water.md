### Water as a solvent

^5893c1

- Why is water a powerful solvent? ^f8bc82
- ![[Pasted image 20220520135340.png]]
- If NaCl is placed in water, it will dissociate into ionic components
- Certain salts are referred to in physio as electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium)
	- nervous impulses
	- muscle contraction
	- hydration 
	- regulation of PH levels

### Cohesion and Adhesion

^223610

- Cohesion - Tendency of water to stick together
- Adhesion - bonding of water molecules to other substances
- Capillary action - liquid to flow against gravity in narrow space
	- plants flowing water upward to leaves from rootes - continuous absorption of water from the ground
	- capillary action ^2254e4
	- evapotranspiration -

### Surface Tension

^9ad51e

- high surface tension is caused by molecular interactions
- ![[Pasted image 20220520140304.png]]
- surface tension because bonds of top layer to the lower molecules.  ^bcdf9b

### High Specific Heat Capacity

^e3bcc2

- Both this and heat of [[8.2 Water and Its Properties#^8f493f|Vaporization]] means we don't boil in our bodies
- Heat Capacity - capability of substance to absorb heat energy
- Specific heat - measure of energy required to heat a substance one deg C
	- Water needs to absorb 4.184 J (missing)
### High Heat of Vaporization
- Heat of Vaporization ^8aa115
	- How much energy is required to turn liquid into gas
	- Water 

- Water evaporating
	- evaporative cooling
	- alcohol - you feel it immediately because it is faster to evaporate

- structure is related to function
