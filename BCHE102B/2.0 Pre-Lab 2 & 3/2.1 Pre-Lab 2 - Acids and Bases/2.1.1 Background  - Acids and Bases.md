## Background
### Acids
- Any substance that releases an H ion (H+) when in solution
	- proton donor
- Level of acidity depends on number of H+ ions that an acid will release

### Bases
- Electrolytes that dissociate to yield hydroxide ions (OH-) or other electrolytes that combine with H+ ions
	- Proton acceptors

- pH indicator or litmus paper to measure acidity or bacisity
