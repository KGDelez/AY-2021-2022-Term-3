## Qualitative Tests
### Iodine test
- presence of **starch**
- iodine dissolved in an aqueous solution of **potassium iodide** reacts with starch to form a **starch/iodine** complex which gives a characteristic blue-black color to the reaction mixture or sample
	- trapped in amylose helixes (amylose-I2 complex)
	- amylose is the soluble part of starch

### Brown Paper Bag test
- presence of **lipids**
- the lipid does not evaporate
	- leaves a stain of oil if positive
