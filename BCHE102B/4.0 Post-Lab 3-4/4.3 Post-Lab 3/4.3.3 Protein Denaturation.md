## Protein Denaturation
- proteins undergo denaturation
	- loses biological activity
	- becomes denatured protein (loss of organizational structure (quarternary, tertiary, etc.))
- In our body, denatured proteins can undergo **renaturation**
	- but not in the lab
		- cannot uncook cooked eggs
	- regains biological activity

### Renaturation
- in the body mostly only
- Some proteins undergo assisted foleding
	- molecular chaperones
		- proteins that interact with partially folde or improperly folded polypeptides, facilitating correct folding pathways or providing microenvironments in which folding can occur
		- eg. hsp 70, chaperonin

### Protein Denaturation Causative Agents
| Denaturing Agent                                     | Mode of Action                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Heat                                                 | Disrupts H bonds by making molecules vibrate too violently. Produces coagulation - frying of the egg                                                   |
| microwave radiation                                  | causes violent vibrations of molecules that disrupt H bonds                                                                                            |
| ultraviolet radiation                                | operates similarly to the action of heat (e.g. sunburning)                                                                                             |
| violent whipping or shaking                          | causes molecules in globular shapes to extend to longer lengths, which then entagle (e.g. beating of an egg white to meringue)                         |
| detergent                                            | affects R Group interactions                                                                                                                           |
| organic solvents (e.g. ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone) | interferes with R-group interactions because these solvents can also form H bonds - quickly denatures proteins in bacteria, killing them (70% alcohol) |
| strong acids and bases                               | disrupts H bonds and salt bridges; prolonged action leads to actual hydrolysis of peptide bonds                                                        |
| salts of heavy metals (eg. salts of Hg2_, Ag+, Pb2+) | metal ions combine with -SH groups and form poisonous salts                                                                                            |
| reducing agents                                      | reduces disulfide linkages to produce -SH groups                                                                                                                                                       |
- bonds that usually form the foldings
	- H-bonds
	- vanderwaals forces
	- electrostatic interactions
