## Qualitative Tests for Carbohydrates


> [!Note] Reducing Sugars
> Carbohydrates that can reduce Tollen's, Benedict's or Fehling's reagents are reducing sugars
> Reducing sugars are sugars with a free aldehyde or ketone group

> [!NOTE] Non-Reducing sugars
> Carbohydrates that cannot reduce Tollen's, Benedict's, or Fehling's reagents
> Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar

### Solubility Tests
#### Procedure
- Drag the dropper towards the test tubes to drop water into test tubes A, B, C, and D respectively
- Drag the test tubes A, B, C, and D respectively to shake the test tubes well
#### Inference
- if soluble, it will dissolve ==dissolution==
- Soluble: Glucose, Lactose, Sucrose
- Insoluble: Starch
#### Explanation
- Starch as a lot of bonds which makes it hard for water to break them.
- A solution to this is to **apply heat**
	- starch granules absorb water and swell
	- the granules continue to swell and eventually rupture
	- the liquid thickens and gelatinizes
### Moslisch's Test
- **Reagent**: Molisch's reagent - ==10% alcoholic solution of a-naphthol== (alpha-naphthol)
- generic test for presence of carbohydrates
#### Reaction
- Carbohydrates in the presence of H2SO4 (Sulfuric acid) produces **furfural or furfuraldehyde** or its derivative
- this furfural reacts with a-naphthol in the reagent and formes a purple ring in the middle of the solution
#### Procedure
- Add Moslisch's reagent into test tubes
- Slant the test tubes and add Conc. H2SO4 slowly along the side of the test tube
- Look for the presence of ==purple ring== between the acid and test layers
#### Inference
- Carbohydrates: Glucose, Lactose, Sucrose, Starch

### Fehling's Test
- used to detect reducing sugars
- **Reagent:** 
	- Fehling's solution A - ==copper sulphate solution
	- Fehling's solution B - ==potassium sodium tartrate==
#### Reaction
- upon heating, the reducing carbohydrate reduces the deep blue solution of copper (II) ions to the ==red precipitate== of insoluble copper oxide
	- the Cu2+ + aldehyde -> a carboxylic acid + Cu2O (copper oxide)
	- originally color blue, turns red upon heating
#### Inference
- Reducing sugars: Glucose, Lactose
- Non-reducing sugars: Sucrose, Starch

### Benedict's Test
- used to detect reducing sugars
- **Reagent:** Benedicts reagent - Cu2+, cupric ions that are reduced to Copper(I) ions (Cu+, cuprous ions) by carbohydrates
	- form ==red preciptate== when in contact with reducing sugars -> Cu2O
#### Procedure
- Add Benedict's reagent to all test tubes
- Place test tubes in water bath
- wait for formation of red precipitate of Cu2O
- originally color blue -> turns red
	- can be also shades of red such as:
		- green/yellow precipitate: traces of reducing sugars
		- orange red precipitate: moderate amounts of reducing sugars
		- brick red precipitate: large amounts of reducing sugars

#### Inference:
- Reducing sugars: Glucose, Lactose
- Non-reducing sugars: Sucrose, Starch

> [!NOTE] Qualitative vs Quantitative Tests
> Qualitative - Either just positive or negative or gives somewhat -general "amounts" (some, moderate, large)
> 	- sometimes need more samples (theres a threshold for the reaction to happen)
> Quantitative - Exact extraction which we can quantify and isolate
> Contents
> 	- more accurate

### Tollen's Test
- **Reagent:** Ammoniacal silver nitrate solution (AgO2 + NH4OH)
#### Reaction
- AgO2 + Glucose -> Glucoronic acid + 2Ag (==silver mirror==) (elemental silver)
#### Procedure
- Add Tollen's reagent to test tubes
- Place test tubes in water bath
- Wait for precipitation of silver mirror effect

### Iodine Test
- detect the presence of starch
- iodine is not much soluble in water so its prepared by dissolving iodine in water with **potassium iodide**
	- this soluton reacts with starch to form a starch/iodine complex
	- ==blue-black== color to the reaction mixture
#### Procedure
- Add iodine solution to each test tube
- check for blue-black coloration indicating for starch
