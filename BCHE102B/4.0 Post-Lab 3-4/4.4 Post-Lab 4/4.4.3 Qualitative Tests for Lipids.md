## Qualitative Tests for Lipids

> [!NOTE] Saturated Fat
> only single bonds within the carbon chain
> of animal origin
> usually solid at room temp
> increases blood cholesterol level
> ex. Meat, fat, butter, etc. as well as coconut oil and palm oil

> [!NOTE] Unsaturated fat
> Contain double bonds within the carbon chain
> found in fish like salmon, tuna
> also found in nuts, seeds, etc.

### Solubility Tests
#### Water
- Lipids are immiscible (not mixable) in water
- Immiscibility indicates presence of oil or fat
#### Alcohol
- miscibility indicates presence of fat
##### Procedure
- Alcohol is added to each sample
- Each sample (formed a lower layer) is heated using a bunsen burner
- Look for miscibility (lower layer has dissolved upon heating) indicating presence of fat
#### Chloroform
- miscibiity indicates presence of fat (like dissolves like)
- no need for bunsen burner
### Translucent Spot Test
- same as [[Qualitative Test Summary#^4b6d5f|Brown paper bag test]]
- When oil is placed on paper, it diffracts light. (translucent spot)

### Acrolein Test
- used to detect presence of ==glycerol or fat==
- Reagent: ==potassium bisulphate==
#### Reaction
- potassium bisulphate (KHSO4) reacts with the glycerol part of the molecule 
- omolecule becomes dehydrated to form an ==unsaturated aldehyde== - acrolein 
- ==pungent odor== - positive test
#### Procedure
- Add potassium bisulphate crystals into the sample
- heat the test tube with a bunsen burner flame
- waft vapors - if pungent, it is lipid

### Baudouin Test
- detect the presence of sesame oil
- **Reagent:** Conc. HCl and 2% furfural in alcohol
- positive test: ==rose red color==
#### Procedure
- Add Conc. HCl to each test tube
- Add 2% furfural slution in alcohol to each test tube
- wait for some time to complete the reaction
- the rose-red color indicates presence of sesame oil
### Inference
- Vanaspati ghee contains sesame oil (5%) while desi ghee does not

### Huble's Test
- detect degree of unsaturation
#### Reaction
- reacts with ==alcoholic solution of Iodine== that contains some ==mercuric chloride==
- the ==violet color of iodine fades away== during the reaction if the fat is ==unsaturated==
	- saturated: violet
#### Procedure
- add chloroform to each test tube
- shake the contents of the test tube
- add Huble's reagent to the test tube
- check for the fading away of the violet coloration
