## Qualitative Tests for Proteins

> [!NOTE] Dipeptide
> products formed by the condensation of two a-amino acid molecules

> [!NOTE] Tripeptide
> Formed by the condensation of 3 a-amino acid molecules

> [!NOTE] Polypeptide
> If a large number of amino acids combine, they form a polypeptide
> a polypeptide having a molecular mass greater than 10000 is called a **protein**. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids.

### Biuret Test
- detect presence of ==peptide bond==
- can also be used for the amount of protein present
#### Reaction
- When a peptide is treated with copper sulphate solution in the presence of an alkali (KOH or NaOH), the protein reacts with Cu2+ ions to form a ==violet colored complex== called biuret
#### Procedure
- Add NaOH into each test tube
- Add 1% copper sulphate solution into each test tube
- Heat the contents of each test tube on the bunsen burner
- Look for the ==violet colored complex== or biuret
- Negative color is ==light blue== color of the CuSO4 Solution

### Xanthoproteic Test
- identification test of proteins with an amino acid carrying aromatic group
	- phenylalanine (**aromatic but does not respond to this test**)
	- tryptophan
	- tyrosine
- Reagent: Conc. Nitric Acid (HNO3)
#### Reaction
- when protein is treated with hot Conc. Nitric acid (HNO3), ==yellow colored== substance is formed
	- the yellow colored substance is the xanthoproteic acid formed by the nitration of the aromatic group in the amino acid
#### Procedure
- Add Conc. HNO3 to each test tube
- Heat each test tube on the bunsen burner
- check for the formation of yellow substance 
- Add Conc. 

### Ninhydrin Test
- test for amino acids and proteins with free -NH2 group (amine group)
- reagent: ==ninhydrin==
- positive result: ==blue colored complex== (or purple)
- negative result: ==yellow color==
#### Reaction
- NH2 group reacts with ninhydrin, complexing it to give an intense blue color
#### Procedure
- Add Ninhydrin solution to the test tubes
- Heat the test tubes over the burner
- Look for the intense blue coloration

### Millon's Test
- Reagent: Millons reagent
- test for the amino acid ==tyrosine== - the only amino acid containing the ==phenol== group
- positive result: ==white colored precipitate that changes to brick red upon boiling==
- negative result: No change in color of solution (clear)
- When egg albumin is treated with Millon's, it gives a ==white colored precipitate== that changes to ==brick red upon boiling==
#### Procedure
- Add Millon's reagent to each test tube
- Check for white precipitate
- Heat test tubes on bunsen burner
- Check for change of white precipitate to red precipitate
#### Inference
- Egg albumin has tyrosine
- Gelatin does not have tyrosine
