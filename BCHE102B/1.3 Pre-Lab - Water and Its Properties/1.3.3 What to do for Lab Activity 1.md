## Lab Activity 1
Hands-on mini experiment

### Materials
- distilled water
- isopropyl alcohol
- salt
- 2 coins (same coin)
- 2 small paper clips
- 2 containers
- 2 droppers
- 2 spoons or coffee stirrers
- stopwatch/timer
- 2 wax papers
- colored surface

### Procedure 1: Comparing a single drop of distilled water with a single drop of isopropyl alcohol
- start by predicting the way that a single drop of water and a single drop of isopropyl alcohol wil look when you put them on the surface of a coin
- observe and record the results

### Procedure 2: Piling distilled water and isoporpyl alcohol drops on a coin
- How many drops of water can you put onto a coin before the water spills over the side?
- How many drops of alcohol before the alcohol spills over the side?

### Procedure 3: Speed of evaporation: distilled water and isopropyl alcohol
- place a drop of distilled water and isopropyl alcohol onto a wax paper
- make sure that you placed the wax papers on a colored surface
- observe the speed of evaporation using a stopwatch/timer
- record the results

### Procedure 4: Comparing how sistilled water and isopropyl alcohol feel on your skin
- on your left forearm, put 2-3 drops of distilled water
- on your right forearm, put 2-3 drops of isopropyl alcohol
- observe and record the results

### Procedure 4: Dissolving salt in distilled water and isopropyl alcohol
- place 100mL of water in a cup and an equal amount of isopropyl alcohol in a second cup
- use 1 tsp to put about 1/2 tsp of salt in the water cup. Stir
- Using a second teaspoon, put about 1/2 tsp of salt in the alcohol cup. Stir
- Observe and record the results

### Procedure 5: Floating a paper clip on distilled water and ispropyl alcohol
- Fill a cup with water, use a small paper clip. it's easiest if you bend up a short metal handle from the paper clip so you can place the clip on the water as gently as possible. Like in the image below

- gently place the paper clip on the surface of the distilled water, then let go
- repeat the same procedure except with isopropyl alcohol in the cup instead of water 
- observe and record the results
