## Guide Questions
- ### What is the difference between agglutination and coagulation
	- Agglutination
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-175918_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- formation of clumps of cells or inert particles by specific antibodies to surface antigenic components or to antigenic components adsorbed or chemically coupled to red cells or inert particles
		- the process that occurs if an antigen is mixed with its corresponding antibody called **isoagglutinin**
			- Isoagglutinin - an antibody produced by one individual that causes agglutination of cells of other individuals of the same species
	- Clotting
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-180220_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- AKA hemostasis
		- mechanism by which broken blood cells are repaired when damaged
		- platelets + fibrin (protein)
- ### What is an antibody and an antigen?
	- #### The Immune System
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-180429_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- fights disease-causing germs (pathogens) like bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi and removes them from the body
			- foreign materials
		- recognizes and neutralizes harmful substances from the environment
		- fights disease causing changes in the body, such as cancer cells
		- stem cell - pleuripotent (not fixed to developmental potentialities; capable of differentiating into one of many different cell types)
			- Lymphoid stem cells
				- T cells - matures in thymus
				- B cells - matures in bone marrow
					- can differentiate into mature plasma cells
						- producing antibodies
				- NK cells
			- Myeloid stem cells
				- Erythrocyte
				- Megakaryocyte (blood clotting)
				- Monocyte -> macrophage
				- Granulocytes
	- #### Difference between antigen and pathogen
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184343_Teams.jpg]]
			- one pathogen has different antigens
				- thus different antibodies can be used to neutralize it
		- **Antigen**
			- anything that illicits an immune response
			- a molecule that initiates the production of an antibody and causes an immune response
		- **Pathogen**
			- disease-causing antigens
			- Can be
				- viruses
				- bacteria
				- fungi
				- protozoa
				- parasitic worms
		- All pathogens are antigens but not all antigens are pathogens
			- because antigens such as dead cells may induce an immune response but not necessarily disease causing
	- #### Types of Immunity
		- By specificity
			- **Innate Immunity**
				- non specific defense mechanisms that come into play immediately or within hours of an antigen's appearance in the body
				- same response to different antigens
				- Such as:
					- resistance of skin
					- destruction of organisms of acids in the stomach
					- chemical compounds in the blood
					- cells called "macrophages" that ingest foreign objects
			- **Adaptive/Acquired Immunity**
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-182956_Obsidian.jpg]]
				- has to have exposure (may be passive mechanisms) to have an immune response
				- resistance of the the body to new pathogens that have infected the body before
				- **Antigen specific**
				- lines of defense 
					- first line - physical or natural barriers in the body
					- second line - non-specific mechanisms such as inflammatory response (neutrophils, monocutes, macrophages)
					- third line - acquired immunity
				- **Humoral immunity**
					- AKA **B-Cell immunity** or **antibody-mediated immunity**
					- consists of B-Cells
					- **produces antibodies**
					- involved with primary and secondary response (1st and 2nd line)
					- With assistance from helper T-cells, B cells will differentiate into plasma B cells that can produce antibodies against a specific antigen
					- Antibodies produced by the B-cells will bind to antigens. The antigens are either:
						- neutralized
						- caused to lyse (dissolution or destruction of cells by a lysin)
						- phagocytized
				- **Cellular/cell-mediated immunity**
					- AKA **T-Cell immunity**
					- immune response that is done by T-lymphocytes through the **receptors found on membranes**
					- occurs inside infected cells
					- Consists of 
						- T-helper cells
						- T-killer cells
		- By development
			- **Active immunity**
				- develops in response to an infection or vaccination
				- Two types
					- **Natural**
						- Antibodies developed in response to infection
					- **Artificial**
						- Antibodies developed in response to vaccination
			- **Passive immunity**
				- Develops after you receive antibodies from someone or somewhere else
				- Two types
					- **Natural**
						- Antibodies received from mother
						- e.g. through breast milk
					- **Aritficial**
						- antibodies received from a medicine 
						- e.g. from a gamma globulin injection or infusion

	- #### Complementary Interactions between Proteins and Ligands: The Immune System and Immunoglobulins
		- All vertebrates have an immune system capable fo distinguishing molecular "self" from "nonself" and then destroying those entities identified as nonself
		- B-cell eventually differentiates into Plasma cell or Memory B cell that will produce antibodies that we can use for immunity
			- ![[Pasted image 20220713183221.png]]

	- #### Immunoglobulins (Ig)/ Antibodies ^7b9424
		- protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen
		- functional basis of humoral immunity
		- critical part of immune response by specifically 
			- recognizing and binding to particular antigens, such as bacteria or viruses,
			- and aiding in their destruction
		- occurs in
			- blood
			- gastric secretions
			- mucus secretions
			- breast milk
		- ##### Antibody Structure
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-183741_Obsidian.jpg]]
			- comprised of 4 polypeptides
				- 2 identical **heavy chains** (large peptide units)
				- 2 identical **light chains** (small peptide units)
			- heavy chains are partially bound to each other in a "Y formation" flanked by the light chains
			- has a **variable region** - which is what differentiates each antibody from each other (specific)
				- where the antigen binding site is
				- reason why there is **specificity**
					- a vaccine cannot be for the same pathogen
		- ##### Ig Isotypes
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184018_Obsidian.jpg]]
			- differs in function and antigen responses primarily due to **structure variability**
			- This classification is based on differences in amino acid sequence in the constant region (Fc) of the antibody heavy chains
			- Isotypes
				- IgA
				- IgD
				- IgG
				- IgE
				- IgM
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184116_Teams.jpg]]
			-  ![[Screenshot_20220713-184141_Obsidian.jpg]]
				- **Where is each found?**

	- #### Antibody-Antigen Complex
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184546_Obsidian 1.jpg]]
			- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184605_Obsidian.jpg]]
			- specific binding of antibody and antigen

	- #### How do Vaccines Work?
		- depends on what kind of vaccine
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184826_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-184855_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- generally triggers an immune response that includes the production of specific antibodies
		- ex. SARS-COV2 - COVID-19 - New pathogen, no antibody
			- either we acquire it actively
			- or produce antibodies through vaccination 
		- ##### Types of Vaccines
			- Three main approaches (efficiency can depend on this)
				- ![[Screenshot_20220713-185130_Obsidian.jpg]]
				- using whole virus or bacterium
					- inactivated vaccine - dead; removes what can cause adhesion or replication; prevents you from being infected
					- live-attenuated vaccine - weakened, but live
					- viral vector vaccine - uses a viral vector (modified virus with the genetic material of the antigen) to deliver genetic material coding for a desired antigen into the recepient's host cells
				- parts that trigger the immune system
					- only uses the very specific parts (subunits) of a virus or bacterium that the immune system needs to recognize
					- enough to cause an immune response
				- just the genetic material
					- uses the genetic material for specific proteins
					- the DNA or RNA
			- generally done to trigger immune response
				- produce antibodies
				- eventually eliminated

- ### What is Rhesus Incompatibility?
	- #### The Rh Factor
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-190024_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- an inherited protein found on the surface of RBC
			- D-antigen
		- if blood type is Rh positive -> blood cells have Rh protein
		- if blood type is negative -> blood cells lack Rh protein
	- #### Rhesus Incompatibility
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-190138_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Occurs during pregnancy when mother is Rh negative and the baby is Rh positive
		- Mother's antibodies attack second offspring's (and further's) red blood cells
		- may cause 
			- miscarriage
			- if survive, hemolytic disease
		- Blood type of parents are INCOMPATIBLE

- ### What is RhoGAM?
	- ![[Pasted image 20220713190549.png]]
	- Rho(D) Immune Globulin (Human)
	- a prescription medicine that is used to prevent **Rh immunization**
		- a condition in which an individual with Rh-negative blood develops antibodies after exposure to Rh-positive blood
	- condition in which individual with Rh-negative blood develops antibodies after exposure to Rh-positive blood
