- from this activity, the tests are **qualitative** but we dont know if the value is acceptable or significant (needs quantitative)
- if detect something, possible kidney malfunction
## Urine Formation
- ![[Screenshot_20220713-221332_Obsidian.jpg]]
- 3 parts
	- a - glomerular filtration
		- water and solutes smaller than proteins are forced through capillary walls and pores of the glomerular capsule -> renal tubule
	- b - selective reabsorption
		- if ever there are still molecules that are valuable
		- the following are transported out of the filtrate into the tubule cells -> enter the capillary blood
			- water
			- glucose
			- amino acids
			- needed ions
	- c- tubular secretion 
		- items that are bad or in excess or not needed are secreted.
		- the following are removed from the peritubular blood -> secreted by tubule cells into filtrate
			- H+
			- K+
			- creatinine
			- drugs
- kidneys filter all unwanted substances from the blood and produces urine
	- -> urine is excreted
- Amino acids are supposed to be absorbed
	- but what does it mean if we find it in the urine?
		- Kidney may have a problem 
		- cannot reabsorb efficiently
- One of the first things we can look at is 
	- color -> to know if well hydrated 
		- darker - not very hydrated
		- lighter - hydrated
