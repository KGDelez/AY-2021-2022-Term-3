## Nitrogenous Waste Products

- **Why is urine formation important?**
	- we produce nitrogenous bases from
		- amino acids that are unused
		- some other nitrogenous bases
	- there are times that amino acids can be recycled to form other amino acids
		- but there are times we need to remove amine groups
	- Mammals -> excrete nitrogenous wastes through **urea**
- **Urea Cycle**
	- ![[Screenshot_20220713-220403_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Part of the urea cycle forms products that can be used in
		- TCA such as
			- fumarate
			- arginine (metabolised by arginase to produce ornithine with urea as a byproduct)
			- ornithine (goes back to the cycle)
				- binds with carbomoyl phosphate to produce citruline
				- the cycle goes around again to produce urea

		- Proteins are in diet. Where do amino acids from the proteins go?
			- carbon backbone -> enters the citric acid cycle
				- citric acid cycle -> the utilization of glucose from gluconeogenesis
			- ammonia (NH4+) 
				- used to produce
					- amino acids
					- nucleotides
					- biological amines
				- or produce **carbomoyl phosphate** -> urea cycle
					- produces urea
					- removes nitrogen product
			- it depends whether the amino acid is going to still be used, otherwise the nitrogen product is excreted
