## Fatty Acid Oxidation Background 

- ### Oxidation-reduction reactions AKA redox reactions
	- ![[Screenshot_20220713-092407_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from one species to anther
	- **oxidized** - the species that loses electrons
	- **reduced** - species that gains electrons
	- **oxidizing agent** - the thing that takes the electrons (ends up with electrons in the end and is therefore, reduced)
	- **reducing agent** - the thing that loses the electrons
	- very important in many metabolic pathways
- ### Omega 3 fatty acids

	- particularly high in fish oils
	- very susceptible to oxidation
- ### Digestion, mobilization, and transport of fats
	- Where can we obtain fats? Cells can obtain fatty acid fuels from 3 sources
		- diet (ingestion)
		- fats stored in cells as lipid droplets (from ingested fats not used as energy)
		- fats synthesized in one organ for export to another

		- Why fats aren't primarily used for energy
		- before we can put fatty acid inside membrane, it has a long process
		- carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for most, but not all, cells of the body. 
			- because easily metabolized
			- easier to break down and transport -> because soluble
		- digestion happens in stomach -> bile (made by liver) from gall bladder emulsifies fats forming micelles -> intestinal lipases degrade triacylglycerols 
		- -> fatty acids and other breakdown products are taken up by intestinal mucosa and converted to triacylglycerols
		- -> triacylglycerols are incorporated, with cholesterols and apolipoproteins, into chylomicrons
		- -> chylomicrons move through lymphatic system and bloodstream to tissues
		- -> lipoprotein lipase converts triacylglycerols into fatty acids and glycerol
		- -> fatty acids enter cells -> oxidized as fuel or reesterified for storage
		- micelles
			- lipids have hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail
			- hydrophilic heads are outside, and tails are inside
			- with lipase, triacylglycerols are degraded
				- 3 fatty acids together
				- have to be broken down to individual fatty acids
				- individual fatty acids are transported
		- Transportation of fatty acids already a problem as they are not soluble
		-  More problems when it comes to energy utilization
		- Carbohydrates -> glycolysis -> pyruvate -> Acetyl CoA -> TCA -> ETC
			- when sugar is low in the bloodstream:
				- gluconeogenesis - utilization of non-carbohydrate precursors to create glucose
				- increase lipid utilization

		- Neutral lipids are stored in **adipocytes** in the form of **lipid droplets**
		- The surface of these droplets is coated with **perilipins**
			- proteins that restrict access to the lipid droplets
			- prevents **untimely lipid mobilization**
		- Hormones trigger mobilization of **stored triacylglycerols**
			- low blood glucose leves: epinephrine and glucagon are secreted
				- epinephrine - gluconeogenesis
					- hormone that signifies DANGER!
				- glucacgon - glycogenolysis
					- stored glycogen broken down into glucose
				- this activates the enzyme **adenylyl cyclase** in the adipocyte plasma membrane which produces the second messenger **cAMP**
			- high sugar -> release of insulin
			- insulin and glucagon - negative feedback mechanism
				- can't be released at the same time
			- **cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA)** phosphorylates perilipin A
				- causes lipase to move from cytosol to lipid droplet surface
	- #### Oxidation of Fatty Acids
		- occurs in multiple regions of the cell
			- the mitochondria - only beta-oxidation
			- peroxisome - alpha and beta-oxiddation occur
			- endoplasmic reticulum - omega-oxidation
		- Beta-oxidation
			- significant source of metabolic energy during interprandial periods and high energy demand states such as exercise
			- the one that is tapped when there is a lack of energy source
		- Omega-oxidation
			- alternative oxidation pathway for B-oxidation when B-oxidation is blocked
	- #### **Fatty acid oxidation**
		- ![[Screenshot_20220713-095758_Teams.jpg]]
		- the mitochondrial aerobic process of breaking down a fatty acid into acetyl-CoA subunit
		- Glycolysis 
			- breakdown one glucose unit -> pyruvate
				- other than pyruvate, gives
					- 2 ATP
					- NADH
				- pyruvate -> convert to Acetyl CoA
					- can move to TCA (AKA Krebs, Citric Acid, Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle) and gives
						- 1 ATP/GTP
						- 3 NADH - electron carrier
						- 1 FADH2 - electron carrier
			- NADH and FADH2 from pyruvate (glycolysis) and TCA fuels **oxidative phosphorylation**
				- oxidative phosphorylation can happen in 2 ways
					- (1) substrate level phosphorylation - How ATP is produced from glycolysis and TCA
					- (2) oxidative phosphorylation - a coupled reaction between Electron transport chain and Chemiosmosis
						- creates a proton gradient 
							- higher H ions in the outside of mitochondiral matrix (intermembrane space) compared to inner (inside of matrix)
							- when H+ ions go into ATP synthase -> converts ADP to ATP
					- **YOU CAN MAKE MORE ATP IN OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION THAN IN SUBSTRATE LEVEL PHOSPHORYLATION
						- main goal - give us high amount of ATP
						- gives roughly about 30 ATP
		- ##### Beta-oxidation
			- oxidation of fatty acids
			- gives us Acetyl CoA 
			- same process but no glycolysis
			- Acetyl CoA -> TCA -> oxidative phosphorylation -> roughly 30 ATP
		- Fatty acid oxidation is an alternative option

		- **Fatty Acyl-CoA** 
		- Beta-oxidation is a way we can create Acetyl CoA
