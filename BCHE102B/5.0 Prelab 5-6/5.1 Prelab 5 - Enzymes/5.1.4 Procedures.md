## Procedures for Online
1. Prepare the gelatin as stated in the packet instructions. Divide the gelatin into 3 equal amounts then put them in 3 separate containers. Let the gelatins set in the refrigerator. Once the gelatins are firm, proceed to the next procedure
2. Label the containers A-C then follow the experimental setup below
	A. Gelatin only (control)
	B. Gelatin + fresh pineapple slices
	C. Gelatin + boiled pineapple slices
3. Set aside for 30 Minutes. Observe and record the results.

## Procedures for Salivary Amylase on Starch (Online)
1. Prepare 100mL starch solution. Divide the solution into two equal parts and place them in separate containers. Do not forget to put labels A and B on your contaienrs
2. In container A, add 10 drops of iodine solution then stir until it is completely blended. Take note of the color
3. In container B, add saliva. Mix thoroughly. Add 10 drops of iodine solution then stir until it is completely blended. Take note of the color.
4. Set aside for 30 minutes. Take note what will happen to both containers. Record the results.

## Procedures for Analysis of Enzymes
**Procedure for Catalase**
1. Take several pieces of the cubed potato and put into test tubes. Label 1 set of test tubes, HOT TEMP, ROOM TEMP, COLD TEMP. Keep the ROOM TEMP test tube in the test tube rack. Take the test tube labeled as HOT TEMP and put into boiling water for 5 minutes. Put test tube labeled as COLD TEMp in bowl of ice for at least 5 minutes.
2. Put all three test tubes in test tube rack. Add 10mL of hydrogen peroxide to room temperature test tube first. Observe the reaction and record. if there is catalase present, foam should be produced. The foam produced is a result of catalase converting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen; the bubbles are filled with this oxygen. The more bubbles produced the faster catalase is carrying out this reaction, or the more catalase present.
3. Next, add 10mL of hydrogen peroxide into the test tube labeled COLD TEMP, record observations. Lastly, add 10mL hydrogen peroxide to the test tube labeled HOT TEMP. Record your observations.
4. Put several pieces of cubed potato into the second set of test tubes. Label the test tubes: ACIDIC, NEUTRAL, and BASIC. Add a pinch of sodium bicarbonate to the test tube labeled as BASIC. Add 10mL of acetic acid to the test tube with the label ACIDIC. Do not add anything to the test tube labeled as NEUTRAL. Take the glass stirring rod and mash the potato cubes. Let the test tubes sit for 5 minutes. Add 10mL of hydrogen peroxide to each test tube and record your observations.
