## DNA Extraction
### Nucleotides

- A nitrogenous base
- A pentose (5-carbon) sugar
- A phosphate group

### Background
![[Screenshot_20220610-101755_Teams.jpg]]
- 2 main types of nucleic acids
	- DNA
	- RNA
- Both DNA and RNA are made from nucleotides, each containing a **5 carbon sugar backbone, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen base**
- DNA provides the code for the cell's activities, while RNA converts that code into proteins to carry out cellular functions.
- DNA is also the one responsible for producing molecules such as proteins
	- not just for genetics
	- One strand of the DNA is transcribed to make RNA which then makes amino acids which then makes proteins
- The sequence of nitrogen bases (ATCG) in DNA is what forms an organisms traits
	- Adenine
	- Thymine
	- Guanine
	- Cytosine
- The nitrogen bases for A and T (or U in RNA) always go together and C and G always go together, forming the 5'-3' phosphodiester linkage found in the nucleic acid molecules.
