- deal with macromolecules 
- establish the connection between biochem and medicine

### Genetic Diseases
- Relates to Nucleic Acids 
	- DNA - Deoxyribonucleic acid - blueprint of Life
		- way we function is encoded in the genes
	- RNA 
- Ex. Haemophilia
	- often seen in royals/ royal blood because of inbreeding
	- mutation of specific gene in X chromosome
	- Romanovs of Russia (Alexei) had Haemophilia A
	- Try not to get serious injury because hard to clot/coagulate wounds
		- can die because of excessive bleeding
	- Haemophilia A 
		- Absent/not much of Clotting Factor (CF) VIII 
		- X-linked Disease
	- Haemophilia B
		- Absent/not much of CF IX
	- Normal Coagulation:
		- Coagulation Factors + Thrombocytes work together to form clot/plug
	- Coagulation Factors are **Protein Derived**

### Sickle Cell Anemia
- protein - specifically haemoglobin
	- a protein with a heme unit
	- binds with oxygen to transport O2 throughout the body
- If sickle cell disease -> definetly is sickle cell anemic
- The RBC looks like a sickle/ C shaped, rather than donut shaped
- Structure -> function
	- thus the difference in structure will make function be abnormal
- People with Sickle Cell Disease are not allowed to engage in strenuous activities

### Atherosclerosis
- excess fat causes plaque buildup and pathway of blood gets smaller
	- chest pain (coronary of the heart often has plaque buildup)
	- pain/problems with lower limbs

### Diabetes Mellitus
- Type 1 - Pancreas fail to produce insulin
- Type 2 - Insulin but there is a problem with insullin receptors in cells
- Familial - some genetic
