## Characteristics of Life
![[Pasted image 20220428102053.png]]
- Responsiveness
- Regulation 
- Growth
- Organization -> Order (structural organization)
- Reproduction
- Metabolism (Definition: [[2.7 - Cell#^8aa217]])
- Adaptability
- Development


#### How do living organisms differ from inanimate objects?
- Characteristics of Life [[4.2 Review of Basic Biology Concepts#^beb768]] 
#### How living organisms and inanimate objects similar?
- both have a chemical basis

### Organization/Order
- Maintain barriers from internal and external environments
	- Skin (outside of body and inside of body)
	- Cell membrane (intracellular and extracellular)
- Ex. Compartmentalization
	- Only in Eukaryotic Cells

### Regulation
- goes hand in hand with response to environment
- maintain **Homeostasis** [[3.2 Biochemistry Definition#^a5cb65]]
	- tendency to resist change to maintain a stable and relatively constant internal env.
	- Where endocrine system comes in
		- different glands that are responsible for the release/secretion of hormones
		- Feedback Mechanisms [[3.2 Biochemistry Definition#^64645c]]
			- Positive
				- Low Blood sugar 
				- -> Pancreas Alpha cells -> glucagon
				- -> glucagon -> liver -> release glycogen stores into Glucose
			- Negative
				- After eating glucose levels increase
				- Pancreatic beta cells produce insulin [[3.2 Biochemistry Definition#^b8b313]]
				- Insulin binds to insulin receptors in cell
				- Convert glucose into glycogen -> stored in liver -> lower Blood Sugar Level

### Growth and Development
- growth - increase in size
- development - maturation
	- with down syndrome, cognitive development is different
	- possibly also environmental conditions

### Metabolism [[2.7 - Cell#^8aa217]]
- anabolism - synthesis
	- utilizing energy
	- endergonic/endothermic
	- Ex. Photosynthesis
		- CO2 + H2O - sun->  C6H12O6 + O2
		- C6H12O2 - More complex from simple
- Catabolism - breakdown
	- releasing energy
	- exergonic/exothermic
	- complex to simple (glycogen -> glucose)

- when exercising there is wear and tear in muscles
- and this makes stronger muscles when they regenerate again

### Regulation
- Normal Internal temp of Humans:: 36.4 - 37.6 C
- Skin - has different sensory receptors -> sensory neurons -> interneurons -> CNS (Brain) -response-> interneurons -> motor neurons
	- when hot
		- sweat
		- vasodilation
	- when cold
		- shivering -> produce heat through muscle contraction
		- vasoconstriction

### Reproduction
- asexual
		- mitosis
		- binary fission
		- budding
		- gemmule formation
		- parthenogenesis
	- makes exact copy of parent
- sexual
	- egg cell + sperm cell
	- has **crossing over** and gives recombination of genes
