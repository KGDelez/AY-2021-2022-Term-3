- the Hierarchy of Biological Organization showing emergent properties from one level to another
- ![[Pasted image 20220428101127.png]]
- living beings - have metabolic activities

- life begins in the cell
	- when going to higher levels not same properties
	- Because of **Emergent Properties**
		- Muscle cell -> muscle tissue - not same properties
			- muscle tissue 
					- -> smooth - organs (largely digestive tract)
					- -> cardiac - heart
					- -> skeletal - attached to bones and are voluntary
				- not same structure -> not same function
		- muscle tissue -> Heart
			- Is it only cardiac tissue? 
				- no it has also connective (generally organs have different types of tissue together)
