## D and L Sugars

## How to determine D or L
1. find the carbonyl if its aldose or ketose
2. locate the chiral center furthest from C=O
3. See if OH is on the right (D-sugar) or on the left (L-sugar)

- the chiral center is C2
- (link chirality)

- 2 Chiral Carbons - C2 and C3
- C3 is the base of chirality because its the one furthest from C 1

- 3 Chiral Centers - C2 to C4
- D and L sugars are **enantiomers**

- All are C6H12O6 (talking about D sugars)
- Point of difference of D Glucose and D Mannose
	- C2 is different - the epimeric difference/region
	- thus they are **epimers**
		- difference with 1 chiral center

1. Aldose D-sugar
2. Ketose L-sugar - 2 Chiral Centers - 3 and 4 only
3. Aldose D-sugar - 1 Chiral center - C2 only
4. Aldose D-sugar
5. Ketose L-sugar - 1 chiral center - C3 only
