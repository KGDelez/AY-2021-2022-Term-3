## Carbohydrates Review
* Elements Present: C H O
* Empirical Formula: CnH2nOn or (CH2O)n
	* n = Number of C -> changes when more than monosaccharide because of glycosidic bond
* Building Blocks/Monomeric Units: Monosaccharides (1 sugar unit)
	* Polyhydroxy aldehyde - aldose
	* Polyhydroxy ketone - ketose
	* Categorization can also be done with number of C 
		* 3C - triose
		* 4C - tetrose
		* 5C - pentose
		* 6C - hexose
* Disaccharides and polysaccharides have **Glycosidic bonds**

1. Aldohexose - Carbon 1 has C = O
2. Ketopentose - Carbon 2 has C = O
3. Aldotriose
4. Aldopentose
5. Ketotetrose
