## Converting Fischer to Haworth
![[Screenshot_20220519-100523_Obsidian.jpg]]

- Hemiacetal and hemiketal (aldehyde and ketones respectively)
- pyranose and furanose (6 membered and 5 membered rings respectively)

### Step 1: Number Carbons and Draw Fischer Stereochemistry
- highest priority is the lowest possible number (therefore functional groups)

### Step 2: Rotate the Fischer 90 degreese clockwise![[Screenshot_20220519-101018_Obsidian.jpg]]
- if on the right, it is downward
- if left, it is upward

### Step 3: Bond rotation on C5

 what if not do bond  rotation?
	- On haworth, C5 hydrogen (left most figure) would be on top and OH will be below if no bond rotation
	- ![[Screenshot_20220519-101448_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- OH of Ch2OH (above) will be slightly negative and CH of C1 is slightly positive therefore making a bond between them because attraction
	- ![[Screenshot_20220519-101559_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- O of C5 will then become slightly postive and O of C1 will become slightly negative. The H connected to O of C5 then dissociates and connects to O of C1, becoming OH (nucleophilic attack)
	- ![[Screenshot_20220519-101738_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- it is now a seven membered ring though, not 6.
		- thus need bond rotation because this is not possible

## Step 4: Closure of the Ring
- C5 H is now below because of bond rotation (clockwise -ish) - should be the one that is furthest (chiral furthest from functional group)
	- CH2OH is now above and OH is now on the right
- OH of C5 is slightly negative and C1 is slightly positive thus C1 and O of C1 will destroy one of the double bonds and C1 forms a b ond with OH
	- H of OH of C5 will dissociate and connect to O of C1
- ![[Screenshot_20220519-102415_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Alpha -> C1(OH), C6 (CH2OH) = Opposite sides (one up and one down) ^0f0c25
- Beta -> same sides
- ![[Screenshot_20220519-102540_Obsidian.jpg]]
- there are times that CH2OH is also below

## What about 5 membered rings?
- same 
- C4 is furthest chiral center. The OH of C4 will attack the C=O of Carbon 1
	- rotation is at C4
	- OH goes to CH2OH part, CH2OH goes to H, and H goes to OH (bond rotation)
	- ![[Screenshot_20220519-103046_Obsidian.jpg]]
- How do we know if C1 is up or down? 
	- because alpha furanose thus it is opposite sides
	- if no alpha or beta, two answers - one up one down

## How many chiral centers?
![[Screenshot_20220519-103452_Teams.jpg]]
- fischer has 3 chiral centers
- Haworth has 4 C1 - C4 (haworth always has 1 more chiral center than fischer even for pyranoses because of C1)

## Practice Exercise 2
![[Screenshot_20220519-103636_Obsidian.jpg]]

- C2 - OH above
- C3 - OH above
- C4 - OH below
- C5 - H below, CH2OH above
- C1 - OH below because alpha pyranose

![[Screenshot_20220519-104012_Obsidian.jpg]]

- when the bond rotation we do on furthest chiral center is clockwise, then its (+) - exists more in natural world - D-sugars always clockwise
	- when counterclockwise (-)
	- above picture of fischer is D mannose or more correctly D-(+)-mannose
- The Haworth Projection above is a-D-mannopyranose
	- shows that it is haworth structrure
![[Screenshot_20220519-104401_Obsidian.jpg]]
- C2 - OH above
- C3 - OH below
- C4 - OH below
- C5 - CH2OH below because we revlove counterclockwise because it is L configuration
	- H goes up
	- CH2OH goes down
	- OH goes to the side
- C1 - OH is below because it is Beta
- Fischer name: L-(-)-galactose
- haworth: B-L-galactopyranose

![[Screenshot_20220519-104756_Obsidian.jpg]]
- ![[Screenshot_20220519-104926_Obsidian.jpg]] L - Idose (no need for postive or negative if not needed)

## Fructose or Ketose
![[Screenshot_20220519-105044_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Carbon 2 is the one on the rightmost of Haworth projection as C5 attacks C2 on fischer
- ![[Screenshot_20220519-105350_Teams.jpg]]
	- C1 is always thinking of OH so since B it should be same side of C6's CH2OH
