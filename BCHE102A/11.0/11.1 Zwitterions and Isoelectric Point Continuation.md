## Zwitterions and Isoelectric Point Continuation
> physiological conditions of a living system varies from time to time (but doesn't fluctuate wildly)
> 	36.5-36.0-36.8
> 	Same goes with the pH of the body
> 		alkalosis and acidosis
> 		HYPERVENTILATION -> exhale a lot (rapid expulsion of CO2) -> Low CO2 in blood -> Alkalosis (because CO2 is what makes it acidic) -> high pH
> 			brown bag so the CO2 in the bag goes back when inhaling
> 			CO2 -> Carbonic acid in the blood
> 	This is where Zwitterion and Isoelectric points go in. 
> 		If the pH goes down (acidic) below Alpha Carboxy (depending on the line graph), then the aminoacids will exist as a proton
> 		If pH goes up then amino acids will exist as a deprotonated anion


### Practice Exercise
- ![[Pasted image 20220623115057.png]]
- Polar neutral because it has OH
- Tyrosine
- Low pH -> Acidic -> High H+ (Hydrogen ion concentration -> low OH- (hydronium Ion Concentration)
	- when highly acidic solution, most things in it will be protonated
- High pH -> Basic -> Low H+ -> High OH-
- Reason why carboxyl group deprotonates first -> alpha carboxy pKa Value -> after pH 2.2 it will deprotonate (OH of COOH becomes O-)
- After 9.11 NH3+ will deprotonate to NH2
- After 10.07 H of OH will be removed
- Zwitterion is betwen 2.2 and 9.11 pKa
	- neutral pH

- To calculate isoelectric point, find the pKa values that the zwitterion exists between
	- (2.2+9.11)/2 = 5.655 or 5.66
