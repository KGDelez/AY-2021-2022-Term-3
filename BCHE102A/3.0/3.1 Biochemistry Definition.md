### Biochemistry Definition
![[Pasted image 20220421104616.png]]

- Both living and non-living organisms have basic chemical structures
- before you can become a cell from a chemical level, you need biomolecules

* Hormone 
	* Biomolecule regardless of base composition (lipid or protein derived)
	* ex. Insulin and Glucagon
	* Regulatory Mechanism - this is the biological processes
	* Maintain homeostasis

- Feedback mechanisms
	- Positive - amplifies stimulus
	- Negative - shuts down stimulus (insulin)

- Enzyme
	- speeds up a biochemical reaction
	- Slow metabolic processes would not be able to sustain life
	- Usually if not all protein derived (proteins with slight modifications)

- What is the relationship of org chem and biochem
	- organic compounds (J.J Berzelius) - organic compounds can only be synthesized in living organisms (not true)
		- debunked by Fredrick Wohler - synthesized Urea from inorganic compound

- Organic compounds - carbon based
	- all organic compounds have a carbon backbone
	- Ex. Carbohydrates
		- Carbon Hydrogen ad Oxygen
		- Structures are different
			- with aldehyde group - Aldose
			- With ketone group - ketose

- functional groups
	- determine reactions and properties of the compounds
	- If with COOH it is carboxylic acid
	- Amine group
		- Amino acid - because it has amine group and it has carboxylic group
		- N terminal and C terminal (Peptide bonds)

- Biochemistry - emerged around 20th Century
	- Chemistry, biology, and physiology combined
	1. structure and behavior - physiology 
		- studied complex molecules in terms of structure and behavior
	2.  ways/methods of molecular interactions

### What is the ultimate goal of biochemistry
- to be able to explain all of life's processes

### Pharmacology
- how a specific drug affects a biological system
- Relies heavily on biochemistry concepts - chemical processes, biological effects, and (missing) of a drug

### Immunology
