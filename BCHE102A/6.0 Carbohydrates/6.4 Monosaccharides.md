## Monosaccharides
### Based on Functional Group

^ec34e8

- Either aldehydes or ketones (or derivatives) of straight chain with two or more hydroxyl groups
- ![[Screenshot_20220517-101148_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Ketone ![[Screenshot_20220517-101231_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Aldose (aldehyde group) - right
- Ketose (ketone group) - left

### Based on number of carbons

1. aldopentose
2. ketohexose
3. aldohexose
4. ketopentose

### Characteristics
- classified accdg to chemical nature of carbonyl group (aldose or ketose) and number of c atoms
- Can be straight chain (fischer projection) or cyclical form
- Glucose - primarily a cyclic form and rarely in straight form (in aqueous solution)

- Monosaccharide
		- Dextrorotatory 
			- rotate clockwise shown using (+) symbol
			- usually D isomers
		- Levorotatory
			- rotate anti clockwise shown using (-) symbol 
			- usually L isomers
	- primarily exists in two forms "Left-handed" or "right-handed" forms
	- Classification is based on rotation of plane polarized light
	- **Chiral carbon** ^dfca0e
		- ![[Screenshot_20220517-102806_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Carbon 2 is the chiral carbon because it is bonded to 4 different groups
			- For L isomer, OH is on the left of chiral carbon
			- For D isomer, OH is on the right of chiral carbon
	- **Anomers** - isomers of the anomeric center
		- ![[Screenshot_20220517-103120_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Chiral carbons are Carbons 2-5 (middle structure - D-Glucose) ^266866
		- Which Chiral carbon do you look at? The one nearest the CH2OH group.
