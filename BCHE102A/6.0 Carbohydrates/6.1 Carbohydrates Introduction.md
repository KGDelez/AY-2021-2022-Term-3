## Carbohydrates (saccharides) Introduction
- Energy, rice, bread
- Carbo = Carbon
- Hydrates = Hydrated = with water molecule
	- Hydrated Carbon
- saccharide
	- saccharum -> sweets
	- carbohydrates are often sweet
- polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones
	- or substances that yield these upon hydrolysis
	- polyhydroxy -> multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) -> also known as alcohol group
	- C-H=O -> aldehyde
	- C=O -> Ketones 
	- Carbohydrates can be in linear chain or cyclic
- The most abundant biomolecule
- much simpler structurally than amino acids or nucleic acids
- Many carbs have the empirical formula of (CH2O)n
