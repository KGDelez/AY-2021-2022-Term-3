## Review Questions
### Give one characteristic of life and explain it briefly
[[4.4 Characteristics of Life]]
[[5.1 Characteristics of Life - Continuation]]
### How do we classify living organisms?
- Aristotle
	- categorize organisms based on habitat
		- downsides: too broad
- Taxonomy and systematics
	1. Morphology (structure)
		- Homologous structure - similarity in structure but not necessarily in function (probably related)
			- E.g. wings (bird/bat)
				- forearm (human)
		- Analogous strucutre - similarity in function but not in structure (probably not related)
			- E.g. wings of bird vs wings of butterfly
			- convergent vs divergent evolution
		- Vestigial structures
			- structures from ancestors that have become smaller or are now useless
			- e.g. appendix, coccyx
	2. Cellular organization
		- eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell
		- Eukarya, bacteria, and archaea (latter two prokaryotic)
	3. Evolutionary relationship
		- ancestors
	4. Embryological similarites
		- chordate hallmarks
			- pharyngeal pouches
				- gills in fish
				- ear and throat in humans
			- notochord
	5. Genetic similarities
		- Humans and yeast
			- a gene that codes for myosin
			- gene is also found in yeast but codes for a structural material
	6. Biochemical Similarities
		- Mutation -> slight differences in DNA
			- thus proteins and amino acids made from the DNA coding differ as well

### Enumerate the domains of life
- Eukarya
	- eukaryotes
	- multicellular or unicellular
		- protista (multipel kingdoms)
	- Protists
	- Kingdom Plantae
		- cell wall cellulose
	- Kingdom Fungi
		- cell wall but not cellulose
	- Kingdom Animalia
- Bacteria
	- prokaryotes
	- unicellular
	- can be freeliving or in flora of our bodies or other organisms. 
	- S. aureus - acne
	- E. coli
	- peptidoglycan cell wall
- Archaea
	- extremophiles
	- S-proteins in cell wall


### Prokaryotes
- aerobic
- anaerobic
	- obligate anaerobes

## Why is the sun considered the ultimate source of energy
- photosynthesis
- heat

## What is a cell
- basic unit of life

## General features of a cell
- Nucleus or Nucleoid region
- Ribosomes
- Plasma membrane
- Cytoplasm

### Compare and contrast prokaryotic cell and eukaryotic cell
