## Characteristics of Life
### Evolutionary Adaptation
- Adaptability
- Evolution
	- not an overnight process
	- not individual but population
- Theories: Lamarck vs Darwin
	- Lamarck: Use and Disuse
		- short neck giraffes will make a way to reach tall trees
			- result in elongation of necks
			- can thus give this "long neck" to offspring
		- what is the loophole in this theory? what can he not explain?
			- will these made "long necks" give it to offspring as well? *inheritance*
		- now used in physiology not in evolution
			- use makes it better
			- disuse makes it atrophy
 	- Darwin: Natural Selection
		- population long neck and population short neck with tall trees
		- **survivability and reproductive success**
		- natural selection
			- "survival of the fittest"
		- Will shortnecks go extinct?
			- possible. case-to-case basis
### Movement
- do plants move?
	- Yes. **tropisms**
		- venus flytrap - thigmotropism
		- *Mimosa pudica* - thigmotropism (close because of touch)
		- phototropism - going to where sun is
		-
