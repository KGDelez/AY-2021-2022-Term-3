## Midterm exam review - Water and it's Properties
### What is the Difference of Ionic and Covalent Bonding?
- Ionic
	- Transferring Electrons
	- Strong bond
	- Metal + Non metal
	- Cations + Anions
- Covalent
	- Non metal + non metal
	- [Pure covalent ](https://byjus.com/jee-questions/what-is-pure-covalent-bond/)(non polar)-> stronger than a polar covalent 
	- Sharing of electrons
- Carbon is a non-metal

### What is a Hydrogen Bond? [[3.1.3 Water - Hydrogen Bonds]]
- Hydrogen atoms with strong electronegative atoms such as O and N
	- In the periodic table, the electronegativity increases going to the right
- Bond strength
	- stronger than other dispersion forces (Van der Waals)
	- stronger than dipole-dipole
	- Weaker than Ionic and Pure Covalent though

#### Intermolecular and Intramolecular H bond
![[Pasted image 20220526100756.png]]
- Intramolecular - within the molecule
	- When an H is connected to an O (for example) in a molecule, there is an unequal sharing of molecules. The O has a slightly negative charge because the electrons are mostly there. This is also why H becomes slightly positive.
	- Another atom that has a lone pair within the same molecule may be attracted to the slightly positive H atom the molecule has
- Intermolecular - between 2 or more molecules
	- ![[Pasted image 20220526100936.png]]
	- In water, Oxygen is slightly negative and each H is slightly negative. When there is another molecule that has an atom that has a lone pair it can get attracted to the slightly positive of H

#### Hydrogen Bonds happen in:
- H2O
- Proteins 
	- Secondary structure
- Nucleic Acids
	- DNA and RNA
		- Nucleotide bases
- Both Proteins and Nucleic acids need H bonds for stability

### Describe the water molecule
- Composition: 2 H and 1 O
- Formula: H2O
#### [[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^58cb5d|Properties of Water]]
- Odorless, colorless, transparent, and tasteless
- Excellent [[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^f8bc82|Solvent]]
- [[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^223610|Cohesion and Adhesion]]
	- Surface tension
	- Capillary Action
- [[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^e3bcc2|High Specific Heat]]
- [[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^e3bcc2|High Heat of Vaporization]] ^8f493f

### Why is Water a Polar Molecule?
- Because there is an **[[3.1.1 Background and Key Terms#^f23682|Electronegativity]] Difference** beweeen the O and H atoms. O is more electronegative than H

## [[3.1.4 Properties of Water]]
### Why is Water an Excellent [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^5893c1|Solvent]]?
- **not universal**
- "like dissolves like"
	- Non-polar solutes need non-polar solvents
	- Polar solutes need polar solvents
- **This is attributed to its [[3.1.2 Water Polarity|polarity]]**

#### 1. Dissolution
- a physical change
- NaCl+H2O -> NaCl(aq)
	- forms a **hydration shell**
- NaCl (s) - crystal lattice structure
	- In disolution the crystal lattice structure breaks down but the NaCl **ionic bond doesn't break**, just "embraced" by the water molecules
	- ![[Pasted image 20220526102600.png]]

#### 2. [Dissociation](https://nigerianscholars.com/tutorials/reactions-in-aqueous-solution/dissociation-of-sodium-chloride-in-water/)
- also known as ionization -> release of electrolytes
- When water molecules pull Na and Cl away from each other


### Describe Water as a Reactant
- Dehydration Synthesis
	- ![[Pasted image 20220526103345.png]]
	- removal of water
	- usually for building
		- Ex. Glucose (monosaccharide) -> Glycogen (polysaccharide)
			- Glycosidic bonds between glucose units formed when removal of water
- Hydrolysis
	- ![[Pasted image 20220526103424.png]]
	- Adding water to separate (lysis)

### High Heat of [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^8aa115|Vaporization]]
- single drop of water to single drop of alcohol
- attributed to H bonds -> needs high energy to break down (high heat)
	- single drop of water takes a long time to evaporate
- Application: in the body, we don't boil in our own skin
	- Resistance of body to sudden temperature changes
	- Why have to regulate aquarium temp?
		- Fish kill happens when sudden temperature changes -> dissolved oxygen in water goes down in high heat
	- Thermoregulation: evaporative cooling
		- Sweat is 90% water
		- Phase changes -> energy to become gas
#### [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^223610]]
- Forces of Attraction 
### Cohesion
- same molecules
	- H2O to H2O 
- Water drops stacked on coin -> dome shape
### [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^9ad51e|Surface Tension]]
- The more cohesive forces the higher the surface tension
- Application - water strider and basilisk lizard 
	- the surface of the water doesn't break easily
### Adhesion 
- H2O to different molecules
	- H2O to cell wall
### [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^2254e4|Capillary Action]]
- transport of water in plants
- to do this, adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive and also stronger than gravity
- if high cohesive forces, it will keep water molecules together and not go up.
