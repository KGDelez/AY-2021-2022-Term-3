## Carbohydrates
### Describe a Carbohydrate Molecule
- CnH2nOn
	-  n is based on the number of carbons
- Functional Groups
	- OH (Hydroxyl)
	- Aldehydes
	- Ketones
- Covalent bond

### A type of Monosaccharide that has 5  carbon atoms
- **Pentose**
- 3 C atoms
	- Triose
- 4 C atoms
	- Tetrose
- 6 C atoms
	- Hexose

### A type of monosaccharide which has an aldehyde group attached to first carbon
- **Aldose**
- If put into C2 it is a ketose

### A type of carbohydrate that has 3-10 monomeric units
- **Oligosaccharides**
- some references say 2-10 monomeric units
	- Disaccharides are therefore under oligosaccharides
- Mono -> Di -> Oligo -> Poly

### What is a chiral carbon 
- Has 4 different groups/substituents connected to this C atom

### It refers to the stored form of carbohydrates in animals
- **glycogen**
- stored in the liver and muscles
- plants?
	- starch is the equivalent of glycogen in plants

### Refers to the structural carbohydrate in the exoskeleton of arthropods
- **Chitin**
- Plants?
	- Cellulose

### Two main components of starch
![[Pasted image 20220526111127.png]]
- amylose - 20%
	- H2O soluble
- amylopectin - 80%
	- H2O insoluble

### Glucose + Galactose will yield
- Lactose

### Glucose + Fructose will yield
![[Pasted image 20220526111314.png]]
- Sucrose
	- Glucose is 6 membered ring
	- Fructose is 5 membered ring

### Stachyose and raffinose are disaccharides
- **False, oligosaccharides**
- Stachyose is a tetrose
- Raffinose is a triose

### True or False: Polysaccharides include amylose, cellobiose, glycogen, and chitin
- **FALSE, cellobiose is a disaccharide**

### How do you distinguish between the alpha and beta anomers?
- ![[Pasted image 20220526111850.png]]
- **Alpha anomer - opposite side, Beta anomer - same side**
- Pyranose
	- C1 - OH
	- C6 - CH2OH
- Furanose
	- C2 - OH
	- C6 - CH2OH
### Examine the structure of this Fischer projection of monosaccharide gulose. 
![[Pasted image 20220526112520.png]]
1. is it D or L sugar - D sugar
2. Aldose or Ketose? - Aldose
3. How many chiral centers? - 4 - C2-C5
4. Convert this to Haworth structure? (two structures alpha and beta)
	- Bond rotation of C5 to clockwise because D sugar, thus CH2OH is above
		- If L sugar, C5 bond rotation is counterclockwise

### Study the Fischer Projections to Answer the Questions Below
- ![[Pasted image 20220526112552.png]]
1. Is Galactose D or L sugars
	- D Sugar
2. Is Mannose a D Sugar or L Sugar
	- D Sugar
1. Are these two Carbohydrates enantiomers? If not, how many places do they differ?
	- No. [Enantiomers](https://byjus.com/chemistry/enantiomers/) are mirror images
	- They differ at C2 and C4
2. What is the term that will describe the relationship between galactose and mannose?
	- [Epimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimer) - 1 Chiral Carbon difference
	- Diastereomer - 2-3 Chiral Carbon Difference 
		- thus, **Mannose and Galactose are Diastereomers**
		- Epimer is also a diasteriomer
