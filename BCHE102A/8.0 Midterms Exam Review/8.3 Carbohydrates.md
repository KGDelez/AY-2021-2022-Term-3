## Carbohydrates
### Describe a Carbohydrate Molecule
- CnH2nOn ^164de1
	-  n is based on the number of carbons
- Functional Groups
	- OH (Hydroxyl)
	- Aldehydes
	- Ketones
- Covalent bond

### A type of Monosaccharide that has 5  carbon atoms [[6.3 Size Classes of Carbohydrates]]
- **Pentose**
- 3 C atoms
	- Triose
- 4 C atoms
	- Tetrose
- 6 C atoms
	- Hexose

### A type of monosaccharide which has an aldehyde group attached to first carbon [[6.4 Monosaccharides#^ec34e8|]]
- **Aldose**
- If put into C2 it is a ketose

### A type of carbohydrate that has 3-10 monomeric units 
- **[[6.3 Size Classes of Carbohydrates#^1b8213|Oligosaccharides]]**
- some references say 2-10 monomeric units
	- Disaccharides are therefore under oligosaccharides
- Mono -> Di -> Oligo -> Poly

### What is a [[6.4 Monosaccharides#^dfca0e|Chiral Carbon]]
- Has 4 different groups/substituents connected to this C atom

### It refers to the stored form of carbohydrates in animals
- **[[6.2 Carbohydrates - Functions#^ee8a5e|glycogen]]**
- stored in the liver and muscles
- plants?
	- starch is the equivalent of glycogen in plants

### Refers to the structural carbohydrate in the exoskeleton of arthropods
- **[[6.2 Carbohydrates - Functions#^7a6a6c|Chitin]]**
- Plants?
	- [[6.2 Carbohydrates - Functions#^d245b2|Cellulose]]

### Two main components of starch
![[Pasted image 20220526111127.png]]
- amylose - 20%
	- H2O soluble
- amylopectin - 80%
	- H2O insoluble

### Glucose + Galactose will yield
- **[[6.3 Size Classes of Carbohydrates#^f846e0|Lactose]]**

### Glucose + Fructose will yield
![[Pasted image 20220526111314.png]]
- **[[6.3 Size Classes of Carbohydrates#^f846e0|Sucrose]]**
	- Glucose is 6 membered ring
	- Fructose is 5 membered ring

### Stachyose and raffinose are disaccharides
- **False, oligosaccharides**
- Stachyose is a tetrose
	- ![[Pasted image 20220527105111.png]]
- Raffinose is a triose
	- ![[Pasted image 20220527105140.png]]

### True or False: Polysaccharides include amylose, cellobiose, glycogen, and chitin
- **FALSE, cellobiose is a disaccharide**

### How do you distinguish between the alpha and beta anomers?
- ![[Pasted image 20220526111850.png]]
- **Alpha anomer - opposite side, Beta anomer - same side** ([[7.3 Carbohydrates - Fischer to Haworth#^0f0c25|Alpha and Beta Anomers]])
- Pyranose
	- C1 - OH
	- C6 - CH2OH
- Furanose
	- C2 - OH
	- C6 - CH2OH
### Examine the structure of this Fischer projection of monosaccharide gulose. 
![[Pasted image 20220526112520.png]]
1. is it D or L sugar 
	- D sugar ([[7.2 D and L Sugars]])
2. Aldose or Ketose? 
	- Aldose ([[2.2.2 Carbohydrates#^83d5aa|aldose and ketoses]])
1. How many chiral centers? 
	- 4 - C2-C5 ([[6.4 Monosaccharides#^266866|Chiral Carbons]])
1. Convert this to Haworth structure? (two structures alpha and beta) ([[7.3 Carbohydrates - Fischer to Haworth]])
	- Bond rotation of C5 to clockwise because D sugar, thus CH2OH is above
		- If L sugar, C5 bond rotation is counterclockwise

### Study the Fischer Projections to Answer the Questions Below
- ![[Pasted image 20220526112552.png]]
1. Is Galactose D or L sugars
	- D Sugar ([[7.2 D and L Sugars]])
2. Is Mannose a D Sugar or L Sugar
	- D Sugar
1. Are these two Carbohydrates enantiomers? If not, how many places do they differ?
	- No. [Enantiomers](https://byjus.com/chemistry/enantiomers/) are mirror images
	- They differ at C2 and C4
2. What is the term that will describe the relationship between galactose and mannose?
	- [Epimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimer) - 1 Chiral Carbon difference
	- Diastereomer - 2-3 Chiral Carbon Difference 
		- thus, **Mannose and Galactose are Diastereomers**
		- Epimer is also a diasteriomer
