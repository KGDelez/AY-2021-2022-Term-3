### Monosaccharides
#### Glucose
![[Pasted image 20220531233704.png]]
- C6H12O6
- source of energy
- fuels both anaerobic and aerobic cellular respiration
- often enters the body in isometric form
	- galactose
	- fructose
	- lactose
	- sucrose
	- starch
- the body stores excess glucose as glycogen 
	- glucose is liberated from glycogen in times of fasting. 
- glucose travels through the blood into tissues that need energy, 
	- this is then broken down in a series of biochemical reactions - releasing energy in the form of **ATP**
- most abundant in nature
- nutritionally most important
- six membered cyclic form

#### Fructose

- ketohexose
- sweetest of all sugars
- found in fruits and honey
- good dietary sugar due to high sweetness
- five membered cyclic form
- also known as fruit sugars
- found in most foods but also exists in commercial quantities
	- sugar cane
	- sugar beets
	- corn
	- **Fructose + gluose = sucrose** - common table sugar
- **the most water soluble monosaccharide**
	- dissolves well in small amounts of water
	- makes it difficult to crystalize from water
	- accounts for its hygroscopicity and humectancy. 

#### Galactose

- monosaccharide
- ccomponent of milk sugar
- synthesized in humans
- also known as brain sugar - part of brain and nerve tissue
- used to differentiate between blood types
- six membered cyclic form
- same chemical formula as glucose and same structure but differs in position of 1 hydroxyl group
	- this gives it diferent chemical and biochemical properties from glucose
- the major dietary source of galactose is **lactose** - a disaccharide formed from 1 molecule of glucose + 1 molecule of galactose

##### Lactose
- found only in milk and dairy products
###### Galactosemia
- genetic disorder caused by a defective gene responsible for the production of enzymes needed to convert D galactose to D glucose
- since galactose is part of lactose, infants with galactosemia will not be able to metabolize it
	- builds up in blood and urine
- Undiagnosed cases may lead to
	- mental retardation
	- failure to grow
	- formation of cataracts
	- death by liver damage (severe)
- Treatment:
	- use a formula milk with sucrose rather than lactose
	- this lactose free diet is cricial only in infancy
		- with maturation, other enzymes are developed that can metabolize galactose


#### Ribose
![[Pasted image 20220531233746.png]]
- building blocks of the backbone chains of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)
- Ribose -> RNA
- Deoxyribose -> DNA
- Ribose plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ATP
- five membered cyclic form
