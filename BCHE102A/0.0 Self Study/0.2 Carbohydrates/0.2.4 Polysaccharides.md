## Polysaccharides
- consist of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds
- most carbohydrates in nature are polysaccharides
	- or polymers of medium to high molecular weight
- often not sweetened and show **limited solubility in water**
- identity of polysaccharide depends on
	- recurring monosaccharide units in their chains
	- the types of bonds linking the units
	- the degree of branching
	- ![[Pasted image 20220601001157.png]]
- Can be clasiffied as **homopolysaccharides or heteropolysaccharides**
	- Homopolysaccharides
		- polymers of single type of monosaccharide units
	- Heteropolysaccharides
		- nmore than one monosaccharide units
- can be either **branched or unbranched** polymeric chains

### Starch
- single most important polysaccharide in plant cells
- two types of glycose polymers:
	- amylose
	- amyloectin
#### Amylose
![[Pasted image 20220601001433.png]]
- the simplest polysachharide compsosed of **Straight chain D-glucose units joined in A-1,4-glycosidic linkage**
- 15-20% of starch
- soluble in water and can be hydrolyzed into glucose by the enzyme **Alpha amylase**
- can be detected in food samples using iodine solution
	- when added to starch the color changes to dark blue or black
	- iodine gets trapped in amylose helices
		- amylose (experimental evidence shows) may be coiled like a spring and not a straight chain
		- amylose-I2 complex gives off blue color

#### Amylopectin
![[Pasted image 20220601001456.png]]
- component of starch that has **High molecular weight** and **branched structure**
- 80-85% of th starch
- water insoluble part of starch
- composed of **300-6000 glucose** units joined primarily by **a-1,4-glycosidic bonds** and occasionaly **a-1,6-glycosidic bonds**
	- a-1,6- bonds responsible for **branching** that occurs every 25-30 units

#### What is the role of starch in the metabolic activities of plants?
![[Pasted image 20220601001801.png]]
- (illustration) starch mobilization in woody tissues during spring and winter (in response to cold stress) is being depicted
	- starch reserves accumulate in woody tisseues
	- Amyloplast may be mobilized during spring to sustain plant growth and metabolism during winter
		- allows the production of compatible solutes
			- sucrose and raffinose
		- in response to cold temperature
### Glycogen
![[Pasted image 20220601002229.png]]
- the animal starch (energy reservoir)
- glucose storage molecule of animals
	- synthesized from glucose when blood glucose levels are high
	- serves as a ready source of glucose for tissues throughout the body when blood glucose levels decline
- also important glucose storage for **fungi and bacteria**
	- low levels of C, P, N or S can stimulate glycogen formation in yeast
	- bacteria synthesize glycogenin response to readily available Carbon energy sources with limitations of other nutrients
	- Bacterial growth and yeast sporulation have been associated with glycogen accumulation
- stored in granules in liver and muscle cells
- like amylopectin, is a nonlinear polymer of glucose units joined by **a-1,4- and a-1,6- glycosidic bonds** (but has **lower molecular weight**
	- branches out with a-1,6 approximately every **10 residues**
	- a- glycosidic bonds give rise to helical polymer structure
- more highly branched structure with shorter brnaches
- gives red-brown color with I2 (Iodine sol)
- glycogen -> broken down into glucose -> enters glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathway or is released into bloodstream
