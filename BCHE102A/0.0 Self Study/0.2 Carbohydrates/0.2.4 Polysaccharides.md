## Polysaccharides
- consist of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds
- most carbohydrates in nature are polysaccharides
	- or polymers of medium to high molecular weight
- often not sweetened and show **limited solubility in water**
- identity of polysaccharide depends on
	- recurring monosaccharide units in their chains
	- the types of bonds linking the units
	- the degree of branching
	- ![[Pasted image 20220601001157.png]]
- Can be clasiffied as **homopolysaccharides or heteropolysaccharides**
	- Homopolysaccharides
		- polymers of single type of monosaccharide units
	- Heteropolysaccharides
		- nmore than one monosaccharide units
- can be either **branched or unbranched** polymeric chains

### Starch
- single most important polysaccharide in plant cells
- two types of glycose polymers:
	- amylose
	- amyloectin
#### Amylose
![[Pasted image 20220601001433.png]]
- the simplest polysachharide compsosed of **Straight chain D-glucose units joined in A-1,4-glycosidic linkage**
- 15-20% of starch
- soluble in water and can be hydrolyzed into glucose by the enzyme **Alpha amylase**
- can be detected in food samples using iodine solution
	- when added to starch the color changes to dark blue or black
	- iodine gets trapped in amylose helices
		- amylose (experimental evidence shows) may be coiled like a spring and not a straight chain
		- amylose-I2 complex gives off blue color

#### Amylopectin
![[Pasted image 20220601001456.png]]
- component of starch that has **High molecular weight** and **branched structure**
- 80-85% of th starch
- water insoluble part of starch
- composed of **300-6000 glucose** units joined primarily by **a-1,4-glycosidic bonds** and occasionaly **a-1,6-glycosidic bonds**
	- a-1,6- bonds responsible for **branching** that occurs every 25-30 units
	- ![[Pasted image 20220601001647.png]]

#### What is the role of starch in the metabolic activities of plants?
![[Pasted image 20220601001801.png]]
- (illustration) starch mobilization in woody tissues during spring and winter (in response to cold stress) is being depicted
	- starch reserves accumulate in woody tisseues
	- Amyloplast may be mobilized during spring to sustain plant growth and metabolism during winter
		- allows the production of compatible solutes
			- sucrose and raffinose
		- in response to cold temperature
### Glycogen
![[Pasted image 20220601002229.png]]
- the animal starch (energy reservoir)
- glucose storage molecule of animals
	- synthesized from glucose when blood glucose levels are high
	- serves as a ready source of glucose for tissues throughout the body when blood glucose levels decline
- also important glucose storage for **fungi and bacteria**
	- low levels of C, P, N or S can stimulate glycogen formation in yeast
	- bacteria synthesize glycogenin response to readily available Carbon energy sources with limitations of other nutrients
	- Bacterial growth and yeast sporulation have been associated with glycogen accumulation
- stored in granules in liver and muscle cells
- like amylopectin, is a nonlinear polymer of glucose units joined by **a-1,4- and a-1,6- glycosidic bonds** (but has **lower molecular weight**
	- branches out with a-1,6 approximately every **10 residues**
	- a- glycosidic bonds give rise to helical polymer structure
- more highly branched structure with shorter brnaches
- gives red-brown color with I2 (Iodine sol)
- glycogen -> broken down into glucose -> enters glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathway or is released into bloodstream 


### Cellulose
![[Pasted image 20220601132816.png]]
- A fibrous carbohydrate found in all plants
	- only in plant based food such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains
- structural component of the plant's cell wall
- linear polymer of glucose units joined by **B-1,4-glycosidic bonds**
	- humans are unable to digest due to no enzymes for B-glycosidic bonds
- linear nature of chains
	- allows close packing of fibers.
	- makes it difficult for solvent molecules to pull chains apart
	- thus makes cellulose **inert towards most solvents**
- Cotton ~95% cellulose
- Wood ~50% cellulose
- Dietary fiber in food
	- readily absorbs water
	- results in softer stools
- 20-35g of dietary fiber per day (desired amount)
	- not broken down
	- includes
		- hemicelluloses
		- pectins
		- gums
		- muciilages
		- cellulose
		- lignin
	- Can help prevent or cure **constipation**
	- Can also protect against develipment of **colon cancer**
	- May limit cholesterol absorption by binding **Bile acids**
		- lowers serum cholesterol
		- prevent cardiovascular disease
- Cows, horses, sheep, goats, and termites 
	- symbiotic bacteria in the intestinal tract
		- posseses necessary enzymes to digest cellulose in the gastrointestinal tract
	- No vertebrate can digest cellulose directly


### Chitin
![[Pasted image 20220601132848.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220601132900.png]]
- similar to cellulose in both structure and function
	- structural component
	- difference of chitin from cellulose 
		- loss of the hydroxyl group at C2 with an **acetylated amino group**
- **Polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucsamine** bound by **B-1,4-glycosidic linkages** 
	- linear extended structure like cellulose
- Functions to give rigidity to the exoskeletons of crabs, lobsters, shrimp, insects, and other arthropods
	- functions to protect from injury
	- maintain animal shape
	- prevent fluid loss in tissue - dehydration
	- defense against predators
	- structural component of fungal cell wall - keeps structural integrity, shape and strength
- Inert and practically insoluble in most solvents
	- Chitosan - chitin derivative
		- prepared by alkali-catalyzed deacylation
		- this is commerically used as films, fibers, surface coatings, and untrafiltration membranes

### Hyaluronic acid
![[Pasted image 20220601133739.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220601133751.png]]
- repeating unit is a **disaccharide** composed of **B-D-glucoronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in a B-1,3-glycosidic linkage**
	- each disaccharide is attached to the next by a **B-1,4-linkage**
		- thus, alternating B-1,3-linkage and B-1,4-linkages
- highly viscous 
	- serves as lubricants in the **fluid of joints**
		- provide a cushioning effect
	- part of the **vitreous humor of the eye**

	- tissue hydrodyanamics
	- iron exchange
	- transportation of different compounds in various tissues and organs
