### Disaccharides
- disaccharide - two monosaccharides
- three common disaccharides
	- sucrose
	- maltose
	- lactose
- each monosaccharide in a disaccharide is joined together by a **glycosidic bond**
	- this is also the basis for the formation of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides
	- glycosidic bonds form by **condensation reactions**
		- thus, **1 water molecule** is formed during the formation of the glycosidic bond.
		- occurs when an alcohol or hydroxyl group from a monosaccharide unit attacks the anomeric carbon of another monosaccharide unit. 
		- The anomeric carbon is the central carbon of a hemiacetal or hemiketal
		- ![[Pasted image 20220531225758.png]]
		- The anomeric carbon has bonds to two oxygen atoms
			- One of the O is part of the sugar ring
			- the other is part of an OH group
			- when the alcohol attacks the anomeric carbon, the OH (monosaccharide functioning as a hemiacetal) group bonded to that carbon is replaced by the O of the alcohol (monosaccharide functioning as an alcohol) and the H of the alcohol is removed
			- both an H and an OH is removed from the molecules from the reaction.  -> making H2O
- glycosidic bonds are broken by a reverse reaction called a **hydrolysis reaction**
	- water is used up in this

#### Maltose (reducing sugar)
- malt sugar, found in corn syrup, malt, and germinating seeds
- **glucose+glucose joined by alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond
	-** alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond** 
		- first sugar in an alpha configuartion and its c#1 is linked to C#4 of the second sugar
		- the second sugar may be either an alpha or beta anomer
		- ![[Pasted image 20220531230922.png]]
	- since 1 glucose (glucose on the right) retains a hemiacetal carbon, the maltose is considered a reducing sugar
- produced industrially by acidic or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch. 
- does not occur naturally in foods and found only in some processed foods
	- commonly found in many bakery and pastry products
		- acts as sweetener
		- stabilizer
		- preservative.
	- thus, counted among authorized food additives


#### Lactose (reducing sugar)
- ![[Pasted image 20220531231426.png]]
- Milk sugar
	- Human: 7-8% lactose
	- cow's milk: 4-5% lactose
- Consists of B galactose with a **B-1,4-glycosidic linkage** to a B-glucose (or a-glucose)
- Lactose intolerance
	- condition which people lack the enzyme lactase needed to hydrolyze lactose to galactose and glucose
	- can be avoided by diet that excludes dairy
- two anomeric forms
- synthesized by epithelial cells of the mammary gland during lactation 
	- through condensation reaction between **galactose + glucose**
- Many functions
	- 40% of energy infants get from breast milk
	- Source of galactose
		- essential for biosynthesis of glycosylated macromolecules needed for the proper development of the nervous system
	- food additive
	- pharmaceutical products
- Hypolactation or lactase deficiency
	- insufficient lactase for digesing lactose
	- causes **lactose malabsorption** and may be accompanied with **lactose intolerance**
		- lactose intolerance - most common food intolerance 
	- **Lactase is produced in the small intestine**


#### Sucrose (non-reducing sugar)
![[Pasted image 20220531232101.png]]
- common table sugar
- **most abundant of all disaccharides found in plants**
- produced commercially from juice of sugar cane and sugar beets
- the a-anomeric carbon 1 of glucose joins with the b-anomeric c2 of fructose (**a-1,2-glycosidic bond**)
- naturally occuring sugar found in various amounts in fruits, vegetables, and nuts
- can be natural or added sugar depending on source. 
	- natural
		- when consumed directly from whole plant foods
	- added sugar
		- when consumed from packaged food and beverages to which sucrose has been added manually
- made from **glucose+fructose** units
- glucose and fructose are joined by an acetal oxygen bridge in the alpha orientation
	- easy to recognize as it contains six member ring of glucose and 5 member ring of fructose

#### Non-reducing sugars
- in basic aqueous solution, non-reducing sugars do not generate any compounds containing an aldehyde group
- sucrose - does not contain a hemiacetal nor hemiketal group
	- thus, stable in water because it is non-reducing

#### Cellobiose (Reducing sugar)
![[Pasted image 20220531232915.png]]
- one of the major fragments isolated after extensive hydrolysis of cellulose (cellulase metabolizes cellulose to cellobiose)
	- cellulase occurs in certain bacterial species and other enzymes to metabolize cellulose. 
	- Mammals have endogenous beta-glycosidases that metabolize cellobiose in small intestine
- **glucose + glucose in B-1,4-glycosidic linkage**
- Maltose is digested easily in humans because we have enzymes that break a-1,4-glycosidic linkages but not B-1,4-glycosidic linkages of cellobiose
	- both bonds from between C1 of one glucose and C4 of another glucose
- a white crystalline,**water soluble** disaccharide
- C12H22O11
- Humans can derive cellobiose from cellobiose laden foods such as
	- honey
	- corn syrups
	- certain fruits and vegetables
- Humans **do not readily digest cellobiose**
	- cellobiose is thus used as an indicator carbohydrate for **intestinal permeability**, **Crohn's disease*** and **Malabsorption syndrome**
- This disaccharide is formed as a byproduct of gut flora from the breakdown of cellulose
