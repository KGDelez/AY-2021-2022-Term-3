## Oligosaccharides
- carbohydrates that contain between 3 and 10 single sugar residues
- not relatively abundant in the diet especially compared to disaccharides
- Common oligosaccharides
	- raffinose
	- stachyose
	- intestinal bacteria work on the indigestible raffinose and stachyose present in beans and produces **gasses** that cause discomfort and flatulence

- less sweet than sucrose
- usually used as a box sweetener or for its functional oligosaccharide properties
