![[Pasted image 20220601220052.png]]
- include:
	- triacylglycerols
	- waxes
	- high and low density lipoprotiens
	- saturated, unsaturated cis and unsaturated trans fats

> structural lipids
	- phospholipids
	- glycoliids
	- sphingolipids
	- glycerophospholipids
	- galactolupids

### Triacylglycerols
![[Pasted image 20220601220337.png]]
- also known as **Triglycerides**
- composed of **three fatty acids** with an **ester linkage** with a **single glycerol unit**
- rich in highly reduced carbons
	- thus yield large amounts of energy 
	- as well as oxidative reactions of metabolism
- Functions: 
	- long term energy storage
	- insulation
- Adipocytes: special cells
	- creates fat
	- stores fat globules within the cell
- fat may be hydrolyzed by lipases
- Adipose tissue
	- found mostly under the skin
	- also as thermal insulation, not just energy storage
		- keep bodies warm at lower temperatures
		- warm blooded water animals need a substantial fat layer to keep them warm in cold climates
			- whales, seals, penguins

### Classification of storage lipids
- Unsaturated, Saturated, and Trans Fat
#### Unsaturated Fats
![[Pasted image 20220601220402.png]]
- most are liquid at room temperature - called oils
- lower blood cholesterol levels
- monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat are considered heart healthy 
	- can help improve cholesterol levels when used in place of unhealthy fats
- Sources:
	- Avocado
	- nuts and seeds
		- almonds
		- cashews
		- pecans
		- peanuts
		- pine nuts
		- pumpkin
		- sesame seeds
		- sunflower seeds
	- olive oil
	- olives
	- vegetable oils
		- sunflower
		- safflower
		- corn
		- soybeen
		- cotton seed

#### Saturated Fats
![[Pasted image 20220601220421.png]]
- contribute to plaque formation in the arteries
- Sources: 
	- Food from animals
		- meat
		- dairy
	- fried foods
	- pre-packaged foods
- unhealthy because increase bad cholesterol (LDL- Low density lipoprotein) levels in body and increase risk for heart disease 
- usually solid

##### Trans Fat
![[Pasted image 20220601220458.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220601221103.png]]
- liquid oils turned into solid fat
- Source: some small amounts in meat or dairy products, but mainly are in processed foods
	- commercialy baked cookies
	- crackers
	- pies 
	- fried foods
- Increases LDL and decreases HDL
	- leads to plaque deposition in arteries
		- results in heart disease
- In nutrition labels:
	- partially hydrogenated oils
	- partially hydrogenated shortening
- oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them a semi-solid, leading to **less spoilage and increased shelf-life**
	- hydrogenation: 
		- hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them
		- double bonds of the cis conformation may be converted to trans conformation
> orientation of double bonds (whether cis or trans) afects te chemical properties of the fat
- examples of artifically hydrogenated trans fats:
	- margarine
	- some types of peanut butter
	- shortening

#### Summary of Saturated and Unsaturated Fats
![[Pasted image 20220601220613.png]]
- Saturated Fats
	- bad
	- no double bonds
	- forms straight lines thus can pack together tightly
		- solid in room temp
	- raises LDL
- Trans unsaturated fat
	- bad
	- has double bond in trans or opposite configurations
	- forms straight lines thus can pack together tightly
		- solid in room temp
	- artificial - made from hydrogenation
	- raises LDL and lowers HDL
- Cis unsaturated fat
	- good
	- raises HDL
	- has kink due to double bond and thus cannot pack together tightly
		- is liquid at room temp

### Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL)
![[Pasted image 20220601221126.png]]
- "bad" cholesterol
- makes up most of the body cholestrol
- high levels can raise risk of heart disease and stroke
	- builds up on the walls of blood vessels (plaque)
	- the insides of the vessels narrow from plaque, and can lead to blockage of bloodflow to and from heart and other organs
		- can be the cause of angina/chest pain

### High Density Lipoproteins (HDL)
![[Pasted image 20220601221126.png]]
- "good" cholesterol
- absorbs cholesterol and carries it back to the liver
	- liver then flushes it from the body
- High levels of HDL can lower your risk for heart disease and stroke

### Waxes
![[Pasted image 20220601221205.png]]
- esters of long chain alcohols with long chain fatty acids
	- this can be viewed as having a weakly polar head group (the alcohol) and a long, nonpolar hydrocarbon chain (the fatty acid)
- Fatty acids found in waxes are usually **saturated**
	- saturated because they're usually solid
- Melting points range from 60-100 degrees C
	- higher than triacylglycerols
- Water insoluble
	- due to weakly polar nature of ester group
- Used for
	- Preventing water from sticking to the surface
		- water repellent character of animal skin
		- leaves of some plants
		- bird feathers
##### Carnuba wax
- wax found on the leaves of Brazilian Palm trees
- used in floor and automobile waxes
##### Bees wax
- secreted by bees to make cells for honey and eggs
##### Spermacetic wax
- found in the head cavities and blubber of the sperm whale
- used in ointments, hand creams, and cosmetics
