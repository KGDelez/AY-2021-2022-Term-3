## Lipid structures
### Lipids
- insoluble in water
	- The polar groups lipds contain are much smaller than their non-polar portions
		- the non-polar portions make the water repellent/hydrophobic property of lupids
- soluble in non-polar solvents as well as solvents with low polarity
	- dimethyl ether (low polarity)
- defined by their
	- function
	- structure
- play three major roles in human biochemistry
	- energy storage
		- store far more energy in fat than in carbohydrates
	- parts of membranes 
		- separate cellular compartments of aqueous solutions frm each other
		- most body components are soluble in water, such as carbohydrates and proteins
			- but need insoluble compounds to separate stuff
				- cells or organelles within cels
	- chemical messengers
- do not have common structural features that serve as basis for defining it, unlike other biomolecules that do
- Two general classes
	- **storage**
	- **Structural**

### Faty acids
![[Pasted image 20220601142004.png]]
- building blocks of lipds in the body
- carboxylic acid with an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain that is either
	- saturated
	- unsaturated
	- with 4-e36 carbons long (C4 to C36)
- Physical properties are determined by the
		- length
		- degree of unsaturation 
	- of the hydrocarbon cahin
	- melting points are also influenced by this

### Chain fatty acids
#### Saturated
- ![[Pasted image 20220601142056.png]]
- only single bonds between neighboring carbons
- saturated with hydrogen
- ex.
	- stearic acid
	- palmitic acid
	- both commonly found in meat
- saturated linear chains 
	- the linear configuartion allows the molecules to be too packed together
		- thus allowing the formation of too many intermolecular hydrophobic bonds that stabilize this structure in an almost crystalline form
		- this causes the increase of the melting and boiling point

> As the molecular weight of the saturated fatty acid increases the Melting Points and Boiling Points of it also increases. 
> The increase of molecular weight means an increase in the length of the chain
- melting and boiling point higher than corresponding unsaturated FAs
#### Unsaturated
![[Pasted image 20220601142517.png]]
- when hydrocarbon chain has double bond
- Ex.
	- Oleic acid
- monounsaturated - one double bond
- polyunsaturated - more than one double bond
- Ex.
	- canola oil,
	- fats and oils of plant origin
- melting and boiling point lower than corresponding saturated FAs


##### Trans fatty acid
- if Hydrogens near doube bond are on two different planes
- 
##### Cis fatty acid
- if Hydrogens near doube bond are present on same plane
- cis double bond causes bend or kink that prevents fatty acid from packing tightly 
	- this keeps it liquid at room temp




### Lipid Nomenclature: Structural Notation
- Numbering starts from end of -COOH group
- Structural Notation: indicates number of C atoms
- Ex. 
	- Lauric acid has 12 C atoms and no double bonds so it is **(12:0)**
		- ![[Pasted image 20220601143314.png]]
	- Oleic Acid has 18 C and 1 double bond thus **(18:1Δ ^9)
		- ![[Pasted image 20220601143449.png]]
	- Linoleic Acid **(18:2Δ^9,12)**
		- ![[Pasted image 20220601143554.png]]
	- Linolenic **(18:3Δ^9,12,15)**
		- ![[Pasted image 20220601143613.png]]

#### Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: Omega Fatty Acids
- carbon chain with two or more C=C double bonds present
- NOTE! Up to **6 double bonds** are found in biochemically important polyunsaturated fatty acids
	- two common types
		- Omega-3-fatty acid
		- Omega-6-fatty acid

##### Omega-3-Fatty Acid
![[Pasted image 20220601144054.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220601144205.png]]
- unsaturated fatty acid with double bonds 3 C away from methyl end

##### Omega-6-Fatty Acid
![[Pasted image 20220601144152.png]]
- unsaturated fatty acid with double bonds 6C away from methyl end
