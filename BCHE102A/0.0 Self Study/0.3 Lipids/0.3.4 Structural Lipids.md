## Structural Lipids
![[Pasted image 20220601220118.png]]
- includes:
![[0.3.3 Storage Lipids#^93fcc7]]
- amphiphatic
	- one end of molecule is hydrophobic and other hydrophilic
		- the hydrophobic interactions (with each other) and hydrophilic reactions (with water) make them pack into sheets called **Membrane bilayers**
- membranes consist of 3 major classes of structural lipids
	- phospholipids
	- glycolipids
	- streoids
- membranes are also embedded with proteins
- multiple factors that lead to membrane fluidity
	1. mosaic characteristic of membrane
		-  ![[Pasted image 20220601230248.png]]
		- fluid mosaic model of cell membranes
		- integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules
		- fairly rigid and can burst if the cell is penetrated or takes in too much water
		- because of mosaic nature, a very fine needly can penetrate a plama membrane without causing it to burst
			- membrane flows and seals itself when the needle is extracted
	2. nature of the phospholipids
		- in saturated form, the tails are saturated with bound H atoms, there are no double bonds between adjacent C atoms.
			- the tails are thus, relatively straight.
			- thus, decreasing temperatures compress the saturated fatty acid phospholipids making a dense and fairly rigid membrane
				- more susceptible to rupturing
		- unsaturated form
			- do not contain a maximal number of H atoms
			- have double bonds between adjacent C atoms
				- double bonds result in a bend of approximately 30 degrees in the string of carbons
			- when decreasing temperatures compress, the kinks in the tails elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, and thus make space between phospholipid moelcules
				- more fluid
		- fluidity is particularly important in cold environments
			- better unsaturated tails in cold environments
			- saturated tails makes it less fluid and more susceptible to rupturing
			- some animals such as fishes can change the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to lower temperatures
	3. Cholesterol
		- in animals
		- lies alongside phospholipids in the membrane and tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane
		- functions as a buffer 
			- preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity 
			- preventing higher temperatures from increasing fluidity
		- too much cholesterol extends in both directions the range of temperature in which the membrane is appropriately fluid, and consequently, functional
		- Other functions of cholesterol:
			- organizing clusters of transmembrane proteins into lipid rafts

### Phospholipids
![[Pasted image 20220601230343.png]]
- major constituents of the plasma membrane
- contain:
	- one or more fatty acids
	- a phosphate group
	- a platform such as glycerol or sphingosine to which the fatty acids in the phosphate group are attached
	- and an alcohol attached to the phosphate group
- has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions
	- fatty acid chain - hydrophobic
	- phosphate group - hydrophilic
- phopholipid bilayer
	- cells are surounded by this membrane
	- fatty acid chains face inside, away from water
	- phosphate group face outside environment or inside the cell (both sides aqueous)

### Glycerophospholipids
![[Pasted image 20220601230412.png]]
- four ester linkages
	- contrast to the three with triacylglycerol
- structurally similar to triacylglycerols
	- but have different biochemical functoions
- function as components of cell membranes
| triacylglycerols         | Glycerophospholipids |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 3 ester linkages         | 4 ester linkages     |
| non polar                | polar                |
| energy storage molecules | components of cell membranes                     |

### Galactolipids
![[Pasted image 20220601230437.png]]
- have 1 or 2 galactose residues connected by a glycosidic linkage to C-3 of a 1,2-diacylglycerol
- localized in the thylakoid membrane of cholorplasts and make up **70% to 80%** of the total membrane lipids of a vascular plant
- differ from glycosphingolipids by not having nitrogen
- main part of plant membrane lipids
	- substitute phospholipids to conserve phosphate for other essential processes
- **the most abundant lipid class in the biosphere**
- crucial to establish proton and ion impermeable matrix of the chloroplast membrane

### Sterols
- composed of steroid alcohols
	- occuring naturally in plants, animals, fungi, and several bacteria
- the steroid nucleus consists of of four fused rings, three with six carbons and 1 with 5 carbons
	- ![[Pasted image 20220601230457.png]]
- Cholesterol is the major sterol in animal tissues
	- ![[Pasted image 20220601230508.png]]
	- essential role in cell membrane structure and functions
	- also acts as a precursor to fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin D and hormones
	- composed of 
		- the steroid nucleus
		- one end of the cholesterol consists of a hydrocarbon tail
		- other end is linked to an alcohol group
	- can be synthesized within the body of various animals and humans
		- liver makes 100% of all cholesterol required for the body
	- essential for the regulation of membrane fluidity in animals
	- also increases the permeability of the cell membrane to **sodium and potassium ions**
	- however, if cholesterol concentration is higher than normal, it might combine with other components in the blood and **form plaque**
		- plaque attaches to the walls of arteries and veins
		- results in coronary artery disease
- steroid hormones are potent biological signals that regulate gene expression

### Bile acids
![[Pasted image 20220601230532.png]]
- polar derivatives of cholesterol
- act as
	- detergents or emulsifying agents in the intestines
		- aids in the digestion and absorption of
				- fatty acids
				- monoacyl glycerols
				- other fatty products
			- in order to prevent precipitation of cholesterol in bile
	- signalling molecules in the regulation of multiple biological reactions
		- esp in intestinal epithelial cells
	- interface between the body and luminal contents
		- including microbium
		- bile acids are primary effectors of a host of responses via interactions with specific receptors
	- also interact with receptors in liver cells and other extrahepatic tissues
		- influence vital metabolic processes, including glucose and energy metabolism
	- regulation of their own synthesis in the liver 
		- by interaction with nuclear receptors
- end products of cholesterol catabolism in animals

### Sphingolipids
![[Pasted image 20220601230549.png]]
- have a polar head group and two non polar tails
	- unlike glycerphospholipids and galactolipids, **sphingolipids have no glycerol**
- Composed of:
	- one molecule of long-chain amino acid sphngosine (4-sphingenine) or a derivative
	- one molecule of a long chain fatty acid
	- polar head group that is joined by either
		- a glycosidic linkage
		- or a phosphodiester
- Composed of (another wording):
	- one fatty acid
	- one phosphate group attached to a sphingosine molecule
	- alcohol attached to the phosphate group
- Found in specialized tissues such as
	- sphingomyelins
		- important structural components of the myelin sheath of the neurons.
		- located throughout the nerve cell body and nerve cell membranes
		- make up **25% if the lipids in the myelin sheath** that surrounds and insulates cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS)
		- The human brain and spinal cord are made up of
			- gray
			- white regions
				- made up of nerve axons wrapped in a white lipid coating called the myelin sheath
				- provides insulation to allow rapid conduction of electrical signals
