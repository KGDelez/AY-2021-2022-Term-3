## Lipids - Introduction
- one of the four major molecules
- compound that is insoluble in water
- but soluble in an organic solvent
	- e.g., ether, benzene, acetone, chloroform
- synonymous with "fat", but also includes phospholipids, sterols, etc.
- chemical structure: **glycerol + fatty acids**
- **monomers/building blocks of lipids: fatty acids**
- composed of CHO
	- long hydrocarbon chains
- A diverse group
	- fats
	- phospholipids
	- sterols
- **Do not form polymers**
	- they are big molecules made of smaller subunits
		- unlike amino acids, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates
		- because lipid is formed when glycerol combines with fatty acids
	- NOT a continuing chain

### Categories
- simple
		-  only fatty acids
	- These are
		- triglycerides
		- fats
		- oils
		- waxes
	- predominate in food and in the body
- compound
	- reaction of fatty acids with alcohol
	- These are
		- phospholipids
		- glycolipids
- derived
	- came from simple and compound lipids through hydrolysis reaction
	- These are
		- steroids
		- cholesterol (sterols)

### Functions
- energy storage
	- a lot of calories in less space
	- generally insoluble in water
		- stored in special ways in the body
- structural component of the cells
	- phospholipid bilayer of cell membrane
		- lipid molecule with phosphate heads

### Fatty acids
- building blocks of lipids
- made from CHO
- what makes it different from Carbohydrate monomer? 
	- **More carbon and hydrogen**
		- thus supplies more energy per gram

### Fat Subunits

- Structure: glycerol (3C alcohol) + fatty acid
- fatty acid = long HC "tail" with COOH group at "head"
	- carboxylic acid C=OOH group
	- enzyme acts upon the C=OOH group on the fatty acid head, resulting in an **ester** linkage between glycerol molecule and the fatty acid

### Building Fats
![[Pasted image 20220601140106.png]]
- Triacylglycerol
	- 3 fatty acids linked to glycerol
	- ester linages - between OH and COOH

### Dehydration synthesis
![[Pasted image 20220601140255.png]]
- reaction where water molecule is removed in order to form a linkage between a glycerol molecule and a fatty acid chain

### Saturated Fats
![[Pasted image 20220601140432.png]]
- All C bonded to H
- no C=C double bonds nor triple bonds
- long, straight chain
- most animal fats
- solid at room temp
- contributes to cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis)
	- plaque deposits

### Unsaturated fats
![[Pasted image 20220601140532.png]]
- C=C double bonds in the fatty acids
- plant and fish fats
- vegetable oils
- liquid at room temperature
	- links made by the double bonded C prevent the molecules from packing tightly together
- mono-unsaturated or poly-unsaturated?

#### Trans-fatty acids
- hydrogenated fatty acids
	- improve shelf life and lengthen food stability
- more saturated than natural vegetable oils
- able to pack together more tightly
- more solid at room temperature
- behave more like saturated fatty acids
	- NOT HEALTHY
- Found in
	- fried foods
	- commercial baked goods
	- processed foods
	- margarine
