## Water and Its Properties
### What kind of intramolecular chemical bond holds hydrogen atoms to the oxygen?
- polar covalent bond

### What causs the unequal sharing of electrons between the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen?
- Electronegativity

### Why is water a polar molecule?
- because of the unequal sharing of electrons between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms (electronegativity)

#### What is a hydrogen bond?
- two types:
	- intramolecular: within the molecule
	- intermolecular: between two molecules
- Form between positively and negatively charged parts of water molecules
- hold the water molecules together
- H bonds also happen with other molecules such as proteins. 

### Why is water a powerful solvent?
- [[3.1.4 Properties of Water#^5893c1]]
- Na+ of salt is attracted to O- of water and Cl- of salt is attracted to H+ of water
	- NaCl is surrounded by water molecules (dissolution)
	- eventually NaCl may also ionize
### Surface tension
- high surface tension of water is caused by strong molecular interactions
### Capillary action
- spontaneous movement of water up against a small diameter tube against gravity
- 3 factors that determine this capability
	- Cohesive force
	- surface tension (lower and cohesive force is lower thus water goes up tube)
	- adhesive force (higher and water goes up tube)
### High specific heat capacity
- Heat capacity
	- ability of a substance to absorb heat energy
- Specific heat
	- a measure of the energy required to heat a substance 1 degree celcius
	- Water needs to absorb 4.184 Joules of heat (1 calorie) for the temperature of one kilogram of water to increase 1 C
### Heat of Vaporization
- measurment of how much energy is required to turn liquid into gas
- water has a heat of vaporization of 40.65 kJ/mol
- a considerable amount of heat energy (586cal) is required to accomplish phase change in water (evaporation)

### Water as a Reactant
- Polymer (macromolecule)
	- hydrolysis breaks it into monomers (addition of water)
	- Dehydration synthesis (condesation) (removal of water) makes monomers into polymers
