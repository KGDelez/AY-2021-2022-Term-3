## Antibodies
- ### Immunoglobulins: The Defense Proteins
	- a protein produced by plasma cells after stimulation of antigen
		- without presence of antigen cannot produce immunoglobulins
	- functional basis of humoral immunity
	- critcal part of the immune response by specifically recognizing and binding to particular antigens, such as bacteria or viruses, and aiding in their destruction
		- HIGH DEG OF SPECIFICITY
	- occur in blood, gastric and mucus secretions, and breast milk
- ### Antibody Structure
	- ![[8.2.4 Guide Questions#^7b9424]] (Add antibody from Post lba)
	- molecule is comprised of 4 polypeptides
		- 2 heavy chains
		- 2 light chains
	- ![[Screenshot_20220714-111914_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- is induced fit
		- makes conformational changes (for recognition)
		- without conformational change there is no recognition -> no immune response
- ### Ig Isotypes
	- ![[Screenshot_20220714-112123_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- types	
		- IgA - dimer
		- Large ig - IgM - penteamere
		- smallest - IgG
		- Medium - IgD and IgE
	- differs in function (missing)
	- #### IgA
		- protects body surfaces that are exposed to outside foreign substances
		- found in body secretions
			- nose
			- breathing passages
			- digestive tract
			- easrs
			- eyes
			- vagina
			- saliva
			- tears
			- blood
			- colostrum - first milk of the mother
				- provides immunity to the newborn child
	- #### IgG
		- found in all body fluids
		- the smallest antibody
		- most common antibody (75-80%) of all the antibodies of the body
		- important in fighting bacterial and viral infection (secondary response)
		- crosses to placenta in gestation
			- only one that can cross because it's small
			- new born only has IgG when born
			- helps prtect baby
	- ### IgM
		- largest antibody
		- found in blood and lymph fluid
		- first type of antibody made in response to infection (primary response then IgG)
		- They also cause other immune system cells to destroy foreign substances
		- IgM antibodies are about 5-10% of all antibodies
		- (missing)
	- #### IgE
		- found in lungs, skin, and mucous membranes
		- can cause body to react against foreign substances such as
			- pollen
			- fungus spores
			- animal dander
		- involved in allergic reactions to milk, some medicines, and some poisons
		- IgE antibody levels are often high in people with allergies or parasitic worms
	- #### IgD
		- found in small amounts in the tissues that line the belly or chest
		- it is not clear what function IgD performs, though it may play a role in determining whether antigens activate B cells
