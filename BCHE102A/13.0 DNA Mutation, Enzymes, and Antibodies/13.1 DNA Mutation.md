## DNA Mutation
- a mutation which may arise during replication and/or recombination
	- a permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA
- Damaged DNA can be mutated either by __ (from the below) of base pairs
	- **substitution**
	- **deletion**
	- **insertion** 
- Mutations (happen on a daily basis), for the most part, are harmless except when they lead to
	- cell death
	- tumor formation
- Because of the lethan potential of DNA mutations, cells (particularly eukaryotic) have evolved mechanisms for repairing damaged DNA
- ### Causes of DNA Mutation
	- Errors
		- proofread and fixed by Exonuclease
		- E.g.
			- **Errors in DNA Replication**
			- **Errors in DNA Recombination**
	- Mutagens 
		- chemicals that are artificially synthesized or wastes from factories
		- why factories are not supposed to be near residential
		- organic solvents -> mutagenic
			- as well as some drugs 
		- E.g.
			- **Chemical Damage to DNA**
			- **Radiation**
				- gamma rays
				- x rays
				- UV light
					- accumulation free-radicals (oxidative stress) -> can permanently damage DNA sequence -> skin cancer
					- please wear sunscreen
- ### Types of DNA Mutation
	- (note)Purines
		- Adenine and Guanine
	- (note)Pyrimidine
		- Cytosine and Thymine 
	- #### Base Substitution
		- **Transition**
			- occurs when a purine is substituted with another purine or a pyrimidine is substituted with another pyrimidine
		- **Transversion**
			- when a purine is substituted for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine replaces a purine
	- #### Deletion
		- Deletion mutation = Frameshift
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-100609_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- When you remove a whole codon, it will remove one amino acid
			- if same bases, then it will be ok largely
			- if different bases -> will be another protein -> precursor for other molecules
		- but when remove 1-2 bases - it will change reading frame
			- will fully missense
	- #### Insertion
		- will frameshift
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-101137_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Unlike with deletion, it will cause frameshift even if you insert 3 bases at one time
- ### Natures of Mutation
	- **Silent** 
		- mutated codon still codes for same amino acid
	- **Missense** 
		- mutated codon codes for a different amino acid
	- **Nonsense**
		- mutated codon is a premature **stop codon** 
		- translation process is terminated suddenly
		- only codons need to remember are 
			- Start - AUG
			- Stop 
				- UAA
				- UAG
				- UGA
	- Missense and Nonsense may code for a different protein precursor or be harmful or be useless to the cell.
		- Sickle Cell - Missense
			- base deletion 
			- instead of glutamic acid there is valine
		- Often with deletion and mutation it is missense
- ### DNA Repair
	- happens in the DNA Cycle - checkpoint before Synthesis
	- if need repair, will do the stuff below
	- Enumeration:
		- **Mismatch repair**
			- ex. MutS, MutL, MutH, MutU
				- detects presence of mutated sequence
			- MutS binds to DNA strand with mismatch
			- MutL will bind to MutS
			- MutH will see where the repair needed to do will happen
			- MutU unwinds the DNA strand (like helicase but is for repair)
			- then the Mut will cut
			- gives signal to exonuclease to proofread and determine mismatch -> cuts out the DNA segment
			- Pol III (Pol three/ Polymerase III) -> Fills in space
			- ligase seals it
		- **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**
			- complex proteins are able to detect errors in the sequence 
				- (XPA, XPF, HSSB, ERCC1)
			- will cut then exonuclease proofreads - if there is problem. then cut again
			- then Pol III -> ligase
		- **Direct Repair of Damaged DNA**
			- uses specialized enzymes to cut the segment (rather than producing complex proteins)
			- no need to cut -> will just repair the segment
		- **Recombination Repair**
			- replicates past damages of DNA then 
			- just replicates and replicates then will fix
			- The segments with the DNA error are a lot, and then go to NER or Mismatch repair
		- **Regulation of Damage Control** (more of once the DNA is repaired you have to regulate it and constantly check)
			- p53 - transcriptional regulatory protein
				- associated with 50% of human cancer
				- when the gene for p53 mutates -> then it will manifest as cancer
				- possible that the cancer developed because the family/genetics has the mutated p53 gene
