- Don't memorize pathways! Just remember what goes in, products and where the products go (which pathway next) and when its used 
## Enzymes
- ![[5.1.1 Enzymes Background]]
- Majority of enzymes are protein derived except **ribozyme** which is **RNA derived**
- Activation Energy
	- ![[Screenshot_20220714-104027_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- minimum energy required for a reaction to occur
	- needed to have collisions between molecules between reactants
	- Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction
		- e.g. benedict's -> water bath to increase energy and reach Activation energy (this is not an enzyme)
- ### Nature of Enzymes
	- Enzyme is usually bigger than substrate
	- Enzymes are complex globular proteins and exhibit a 3 dimensional structure
	- Enzymes can be intracellular or extracellular 
		- produced inside cell and stay inside - intracellular
		- produce inside and go outside - extracellular
		- Enzymes can be regulated
			- activators and inhibitors
			- activators - cofactors are activators
				- increase rate of reaction by increasing enzyme activity
			- inhibitors 
				- decrease enzyme activity
- ### Properties and Characteristics of Enzymes
	- Act quickly (catalytic)
	- not destroyed or altered by reactions they catalyze
		- can reuse unless there is denaturing agents
	- can work in either direction (reversibility)
	- highly specific in action (specificity)
		- ex. amylase in salivary glands only works with amylose not with sucrose
- ### Influences in Enzyme Activity
	- **Influence of water**
		- water is a vehicle for chemical reactions
		- without water, it is suppressed
	- **Presence of Activators**
	- **Presence of Inhibitors**
	- **Accumulation of End Products**
		- if the end-product from substrates is not released yet from the enzyme, new substrates cannot attach to enzyme
		- crowding of enzyme binding sites
	- **Effect of Light and Radiation**
		- Certain enzymes are very sensitive to light
			- Enzyme activity is reduced in light and they are denatured
		- Some enzymes need light (UV light)
			- ex. photoreactivation of DNA
		- Radiation
			- presence of UV rays can also denature enzymes
	- **Effect of Enzyme Concentration**
		- rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction is directly proportional to concentration of the enzymes if substrates are present in excess concentration and no other factors are limiting

	- **Effect of Substrate Concentration**
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-105919_Teams.jpg]]
		- At lower concentrations, the rate of reaction increases in direct proportion to the substrate concentration
		- At higher substance concentration, the rate of reaction becomes constant
			- enzymes are saturated
			- maximum line in graph (plateaus)
	- **Effect of pH Level**
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-110142_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- All enzymes have a specific optimum pH where they function most efficiently
		- Most enzymes act at a pH range of 5-9. and reactions occur most efficiently at pH of 7
		- The small change in pH can produce a large effect on the enzyme activity
		- extreme pH can usually destroy enzymes
		- Ex. 
			- Pepsin is a peptidase
				- works on proteins
				- in the stomach -> acidic environment due to HCl
				- the optimum pH is 1.5-2.5 (does not follow the pH range of 5-9
			- Trypsin 
				- also a peptidase
				- in the small intestine
				- works in 7.5 to 8.5 pH 
	- **Effect of Temperature**
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-110544_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Lower temperatures - enzymes are not active
		- As temperature rises, the substrate and enzyme molecules move rapidly and are more likely to collide
		- increase in temp to a specific level can increase rate of enzyme activity until optimum temperature is achieved
		- after reaching optimum temperature, the enzymes activities decrease and totally stop at temperature +-60C
- ### Models for Enzyme Fit
	- **Lock and Key Hypothesis**
		- ![[Screenshot_20220714-110930_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- **Induced Fit Model**
		- more favored
