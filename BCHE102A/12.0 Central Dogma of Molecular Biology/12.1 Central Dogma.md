## Central Dogma
- target for central dogma -> gene expression -> concept of protein synthesis (to express genes it is through proteins)
- States that information flows in one direction from DNA to RNA to proteins 
- Replication: DNA -> DNA
	- cell cycle (s-phase) befere cell division
- Transcription: DNA -> RNA (happens inside the nucleus)
- Translation: RNA -> Protein (protein synthesis proper) (outside of the nucleus)
- Two parts of Gene Expression:
	- Transcription (1st stage)
	- Translation (2nd stage)
> how does mRNA leave the nucleus
> The actual site of protein synthesis: ribosomes
> 	can be free floating
> 	or rough endoplasmic reticulum
> 	RNA leaves nucleus with ribosomes
