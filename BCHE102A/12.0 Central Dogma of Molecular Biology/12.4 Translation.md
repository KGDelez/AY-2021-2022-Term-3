## Translation
- Protein Syntehsis
- mRNA to Amino acids
- DNA is ultimately a code for protein production (gene expression is reliant on DNA)
	- if theres a problem with DNA -> problem with protein
- Proteins in turn make up all the parts of cells which will then control all chemical processes
- Proteins are made up of amino acids
> why amino acids?
> 	very diverse functionality because AA is also very diverse
> 	needed to regulate and control biochemical processes

- ### How it happens
	- mRNA transcribes the DNA (gets the message/code) -> transcription
	- mRNA carries the message from the nucleus to the ribosomes (on the ER)
		- actual sites of protein synthesis
	- rRNA inside the ribosomes reads the mRNA
		- rRNA ensures that the mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes are aligned properly
			- also to catalyze formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids
	- rRNA tells tRNA which amino acids are needed
		- mRNA has codons. tRNA has anticodons
	- tRNA collects and brings back the amino acids
	- rRNA hooks (peptide bond formation) together tha Amino acids into a protein

	- Anticodons bind to the mRNA sequence (Codons) -> the codons are the one we translate not the tRNA
	- Start codon is always AUG (codes for Methionine)

### Codons
- every 3 nitrogen bases on mRNA = Codon
- 3 bases = 1 codon = 1 amino acid (1 aa is equal to 3 bases)
- A codon is a code for an Amino acid or start and stop codons
	- Start Codon: AUG (needed for process to begin) - Methionine
	- Stop Codons: UAA, UGA, UAG - stop translation
- On the tRNA is an anticodon - it is complementary to the codon
- Example: Codon UUU, Anticodon AAA
- Practice: Codon CGC, Anticodon ==GCG==
- Practice: UAC AUG AAA UGA
	- starts at AUG and stops at UGA
	- does not translate the one before AUG

- Codon
	- UUC - Phenylalanine
	- ACG - Threonine
	- UAA - Stop Codon
