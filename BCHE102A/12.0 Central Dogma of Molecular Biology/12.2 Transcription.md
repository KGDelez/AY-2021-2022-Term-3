## Transcription
![[Pasted image 20220707133747.png]]
- DNA - double helix -> has to unwind to have transcripton
- RNA - single strand
	- the open part of the DNA helix (unwinded) is transcription bubble
- The template strand runs from 3' to 5'
- Replication and transcription run from 5' to 3'

- the process of mRNA copying DNA 
	- RNA synthesis (how new mRNA is made)
	- copies a gene and can make many copies'
- Processes
	- Initiation
	- Elongation
	- Termination
- Occurs in the nucleus
- Is just like replication but with RNA instead
	- only one side of DNA is copied (template strand)
	- Enzyme: RNA Polymerase
	- Bases
		- A-U
		- C-G
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707134525.png]]
	- Why 3' strand? 
		- because of the free OH group. 5' end binds to OH group of 3'
			- phosphodiester bond (between one nucleotide and another nucelotide)
	- 5 types of RNA polymerase
		- I, II, and III - for Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
		- IV, V - plants - synthesis of microRNA
- ### Initiation
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707134918.png]]
	- Promoter -> dictates where the RNA polymerase starts
		- are DNA sequences
		- Transcription bubble starts there.
	- Each gene has its own promotors
- ### Elongation
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707135114.png]]
	- make RNA strand longer by adding bases
	- RNA polymerase runs along template strand in the 3' -> 5' direction of the DNA strand
		- Direction of synthesis is 5' to 3'
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707135334.png]]
	- Reading the frame
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707135419.png]]
	- when making a phosphodiester bond, 2 phosphates as well as 1 water molecule are removed in the condensation/dehydration reaction
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707135529.png]]
	- RNA polymerase of eukaryotic cells does not just attach to the DNA 
		- needs **basal transcription factors or Basal TF**
			- ensures there's binding to the promotor then to the DNA
	- promotors - TATA box
		- created with Thymine and Adenine
		- Transcription factors keep binding to the promotor which allows the RNA polymerase to bind to the promotor
		- ==ensures that promotors are bound to the DNA and RNA polymerase also attaches to the DNA strand==
		- counterpart of primers in Replication
- ### Pre-mRNA processing in Eukaryotes
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707135911.png]]
	- Eukaryotic more complicated that prokaryotic (bacterial cell)
	- Bacteria
		- no nucleus, just nucleoid region
			- reason why transcription is faster than eukaryotic cell
	- Pre-mRNA processing in Eukaryotes ensures that **mature mRNA** is the one that leaves the nucleus
	- mature mRNA should have these before going out of nucleus
		- 5' cap
		- poly-adenine (poly A) tail
		- spliced introns
			- uneccessary/junk sequences
	- 5' cap
		- made of modified guanine
		- protect the transcript from degradation
			- because mRNA is not stable -> vulnerable to degradation
			- can be exposed to enzymes/chemicals that will degrade it
		- ensures that mRNA gets attached to ribosome
	- Poly-A tail
		- prior to termination: polyadenylation signal
			- triggers a cascade of events (such as termination)
			- RNA polymerase stops transcribing
			- Enzymes work on the RNA strand
				- cuts up RNA
				- adds Poly-A (100-200 bases)
		- Ensures that transcript is more stable
		- also helps it to be transported from nucleus to the cytoplasm
	- #### RNA splicing
		- ![[Pasted image 20220707140705.png]]
		- theres also **alternative splicing**
			- needed in certain organisms to produce specific proteins
		- find introns, remove them then connect exons together
		- Spliceosome (a protein and RNA complex)
			- Recognition (recognize introns)
			- removal (of introns)
			- bind (exons together)
		-  Example: Splice this
			- ![[Pasted image 20220707141012.png]]
			- Recognize nonsense letters
			- THEDOGRANANDATETHEHAT
		- If introns are not removed -> mRNA sequence is wrong -> wrong protein or non functional protein
- ### Termination
	- ![[Pasted image 20220707141213.png]]
	- happens when polyadenylation signal happens
	- an enzyme cuts the transcript and releases it from the polymerase
