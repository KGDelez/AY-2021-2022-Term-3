## Classification of Amino Acids
![[Pasted image 20220616102252.png]]
- Based on the R-Groups

### Non-polar amino acids (hydrophobic)
- Enumeration
	![[Pasted image 20220616102938.png]]
	- Glycine - H R-group
	- Alanine - methyl R-group
	- Valine - isopropyl R-group
	- Leucine - isobutyl R-group
	- Isoleucine - Sec-butyl R-group
	- Proline - amine group bonded to H2C -> cyclic structure
	- Phenylalanine - benzyl R-group (aromatic ring + CH2)
	- Methionine - thioether R-group (CH2-S-CH2-CH2)
	- Tryptophan - one 6 carbon ring attached to a 5 membered ring with NH - indole group
- Aliphatic -> linear/cyclic
- Aromatic



- Since hydrophobic, these amino acids are in the inner parts of tertiary/quarternary structures

### Polar neutral amino acids
![[Pasted image 20220616103259.png]]
- neutral -> no charge
> OH -> polar neutral
> CH2-SH 
> NH2 -> amide
- Enumeration:
	- Serine - primary alcohol
	- Cysteine - thiol
	- Threonine - secondary alcohol
	- Asparagine - H2N-C=O + CH2 -> Amide group
	- Glutamine - H2N-C=O + CH2-CH2 -> (2 CH2s)
	- Tyrosine - Phenol group 

### Polar acidic amino acids
- has charge
- Enumeration
- ![[Pasted image 20220616103512.png]]
	- Aspartic Acid - (O=C-OH) - CH2 -> carboxylic acid group
	- Glutamic Acid - (O=C-OH) -CH2-CH2 -> 2 CH2s -> carboxylic acid groups

### Polar basic amino acids
![[Pasted image 20220616103636.png]]
- many NH
- Enumeration
	- Histidine - Five membered ring with 2 Ns. One N is attached to H. Ring attached to CH2
	- Lysine - CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2
	- Arginine 

### Practice Exercise

1. Polar Neutral -> with OH
2. Polar Neutral -> with SH (thiol group)
3. Polar Basic -> NH2
4. Non-polar -> is proline
5. Polar Basic -> NH3

![[Pasted image 20220616104342.png]]
1. CH3 is the R-group - Non-polar
2. Polar Neutral 
3. Polar acidic -> with Carboxylic acid group
4. Non-Polar
5. Polar Basic
