## Proteins
- Account forr **15%** of a cell's overall mass
	- Second most abundant biomolecule in the cell 
		- Second to water (3/4ths of the body)
- Composed of CHONS elements (Sulfur in some only)
- Monomeric unit = Amino acids
- Specialized proteins may contain
	- Fe
	- Phosphorus
	- some other metals
- Protein - a peptide in which at least 40 amino acid residues are present
	- Several proteins with more than 10000 amino acid residues are known
	- Common proteins contain 400-500 amino acid residues
	- Small proteins contain 40-100 amino acid residues
- More than 1 polypeptide chain may be present in a protein
	- **Monomeric**: contains 1 polypeptide chain
	- **Multimeric**: contains 2 or more polypeptide chains

### Functional Versatility 
> diverse and versatile because of its functiionality
- diversity of functions of proteins far exceeds the roles of other biomolecules
- comes from
	- Ability to bind small molecules specifically and strongly
	- Ability to bind other proteins and form fiber like structures
	- Ability to be integrated into **cell membranes**
