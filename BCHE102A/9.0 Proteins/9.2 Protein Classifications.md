## Protein Classifications
### Chemical Composition
#### Simple Proteins
- proteins with only amino acid residues present
- more than one protein subunit may be present but those subunits should only contain amino acids
	- Albuminoids - keratin and collagen
	- Albumins - egg albumin and serum albumin
	- Globulins - antibodeis
	- Histones - protein that coils chromatin into cromosomes
#### Conjugated (complex) proteins
- proteins that have one or more non-amino acid entities - known as prosthetic groups
- Prosthetic groups may be organic or inorganic

> take note of the prosthetic group for each class of protein

### Shape

#### Fibrous Proteins (insoluble)
- polypeptides arranged in long strands or sheets
- long rod shaped or string like molecules that can intertwine with each other and form strong fibers
- Waterproof/insoluble
	- keratins
	- collagens
	- elastins
	- myosins
	- fibrin
#### Globular proteins (soluble)
- proteins folded into spherical/globular shape
- Non-polar amino acids are in the interior
- Polar amino acids are on the exterior/ surface
- water soluble - can travel through the blood and other body fluids to the site where their activity is needed
	- insulin
	- myoglobin
	- hemoglobin
	- transferrin
	- immunoglobulins

### Function
- Catalytic - such as enzymes; speed up biological processes 
- Defense - antibodies/immunoglobulins; defense against antigens and play a crucial role in the immune system
- Transport - bind small biomolecules such as oxygen and other ligands and transport them to other parts of the body and release them on demand
- Messenger - transmit signals to coordinate biochemical processes between cells, tissues, and organs
	- Hormones: 
		- insulin and glucagon - regulate carbohydrate metabolism
		- growth hormone - regulates body growth
- Contractile - necessary for all forms of movement
	- myosin - in all muscle
- Structural - for stiffness, elasticity, and rigidity
	- elastin
	- collagen
	- kerating
- Transmembrane - in the cell membrane and help facilitate the movement of small molecules and ions
- Regulatory - often found embedded in exterior surface of cell membranes; act as sites for receptor molecules
- Storage - bind and store small molecules
	- theredin (?)
	- myoglobin
- Nutrient - biologically impt in early stages of life: from embryo to infant.
	- found in
		- milk
		- egg albumin/egg whites
