## Protein Classifications
### Chemical Composition
#### Simple Proteins
- proteins with **only amino acid** residues present
- more than one protein subunit may be present but those subunits should only contain amino acids
	- Albuminoids - keratin and collagen
	- Albumins - egg albumin and serum albumin
	- Globulins - antibodeis (immunoglobulins)
	- Histones - protein that coils chromatin into chromosomes
#### Conjugated (complex) proteins
- proteins that have one or more **non-amino acid entities** - known as prosthetic groups
- Prosthetic groups may be organic or inorganic

> take note of the prosthetic group for each class of protein

### Shape

#### Fibrous Proteins (insoluble) (water insoluble)
- polypeptides arranged in long strands or sheets
- long rod shaped or string like molecules that can intertwine with each other and form strong fibers
- Waterproof/insoluble
	- keratins
	- collagens - also in skin
	- elastins
	- myosins
	- fibrin
#### Globular proteins (soluble) (water soluble)
- proteins folded into spherical/globular shape
- Non-polar amino acids are in the interior
- Polar amino acids are on the exterior/ surface
- water soluble - can travel through the blood and other body fluids to the site where their activity is needed
	- insulin
	- myoglobin
	- hemoglobin
	- transferrin
	- immunoglobulins

### Function
- **Catalytic** - such as enzymes; speed up biological processes 
> if no enzymes, slow metabolism -> cannot sustain life if metabolic processes too slow
- **Defense** - antibodies/immunoglobulins; defense against antigens and play a crucial role in the immune system
- **Transport** - bind small biomolecules such as oxygen and other ligands and transport them to other parts of the body and release them on demand
- **Messenger** - transmit signals to coordinate biochemical processes between cells, tissues, and organs
	- Hormones: 
		- insulin and glucagon - regulate carbohydrate metabolism
			- produced by pancreas 
		- growth hormone - regulates body growth
- **Contractile** - necessary for all forms of movement
	- actin & myosin - in all muscle
- **Structural** - for stiffness, elasticity, and rigidity
		> usually fibrous proteins
	- elastin
	- collagen
	- kerating
- **Transmembrane** - in the cell membrane and help facilitate the movement of small molecules and ions
- **Regulatory** - often found embedded in exterior surface of cell membranes; act as sites for receptor molecules
- **Storage** - bind and store small molecules
	- ferritin - stores iron
	- myoglobin - for binding oxygen
- **Nutrient** - biologically impt in early stages of life: from embryo to infant.
	- found in
		- casein - milk
		- ovalbumin - egg albumin/egg whites
