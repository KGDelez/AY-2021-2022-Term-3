## Writing peptides
![[Pasted image 20220616105326.png]]
- Peptides are written left to right
	- beginning with free -NH3+ group and ending with free -COO- group
> strictly follow exact amino acid sequence
> if adding amino acids, add to the last (from left to right) (the sixth in the picutre)
> 	add at the c terminus of the last amino acid
- C- terminal amino acid (C-terminus)
	- amino acid with the chain having the free COO- group
- N-terminal amino acid (N-terminus)
	- amino acid at the end with the chain having the free NH3+ group
> change in amino acid sequence changes the protein (structure and function)
> DNA mutations -> domino effect until changes in amino acid sequences

### Practice Exercise

- change suffix to yl. Last amino acid retains name
- Alanyl-valyl-alanyl-glycine (some references)
- Systematic - No hyphen
	- Alanylvalylalanylglycine
> follow systematic more
- Ala-Val-Ala-Gly - Three letter

- glutathione -> antioxidant 
- ==glutamyl is not glutamine, it's glutamic acid==
- cysteinyl -> cysteine
- A. ![[Pasted image 20220616110739.png]]
- A. ![[Pasted image 20220616110841.png]]
	- Glutamic acid first, then cysteine, then glycine
	- ![[Pasted image 20220616111108.png]]
	- 1 and 2 are peptide bonds (2 peptide bonds total)
- B. Glu-Cys-Gly

- A. Alanine and Glycine
- B. Proline and Phenylalanine
- C. Tryptophan and Lysine
