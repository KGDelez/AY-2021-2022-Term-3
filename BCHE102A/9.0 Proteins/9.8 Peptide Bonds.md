## Peptide Bonds
![[Pasted image 20220616105040.png]]
- formed ia **dehydration synthesis** or **condensation reaction**
	- simple to complex
	- anabolic (creation) reaction
- The carboxyl group of one amino acid is linked to the amino group of the incoming amino acid
- C terminus has the OH group. 
- Peptide bonds make link between C-terminus of first aa and N terminus of second aa. H from N terminus and OH from C terminus make H2O
