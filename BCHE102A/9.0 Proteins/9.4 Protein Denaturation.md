## Protein Denaturation 
![[4.3.3 Protein Denaturation]]

- Loss of three dimensional structure sufficient to cause loss of function
- disrupts normal alpha-helix and beta sheets in a protein and uncoils it into a random shape
- Denaturation isn't strong enough to break peptide bonds
	- primary structure preserved
- Occurs because bonding interactions responsible for the secondary and tertiary structures are disrupted
- Tertiary structure bonding interactions between side chains (can be disrupted by applying external stress)
	- Hydrogen bonding
	- Salt bridges
	- Disulfide bonds
	- Non-polar hydrophobic interactions
- Many reagents can cause this (see above)

### Renaturation
- protein denaturation was perceived to be an irreversible process
- However given the right circumstances and enough time, proteins can renature and refold and re-perform biological functions
- renaturation proves that the primary structure determines the secondary and tertiary structures
	- primary structures are strong and stable
		- hydrolysis - fairy rigorous conditions to hydrolyze peptide bonds
	- Secondary to quarternary - quite vulnerable to attack, but differ in vulnerabilities
		- globular proteins are easier to denature than fibrous proteins (tough)

### Agents of Denaturation
#### Heat
![[Pasted image 20220614223457.png]]
- can be used to disrupt **hydrogen bonds** and **non-polar hydrophobic interactions**
- occurs because heat increases the kinetic energy and causes the molecules to vibrate so rapidly and violently that the bonds are disrupted
	 - Eggs denature and coagulate while cooking
	 - other food items are cooked to denature the proteins and make it easier for enzymes to digest them
- Cooking denatures the protein but does not change protein nutritional value
- The purpose of denaturing proteins is to deactivate certain parts of a living cell
	- Thereby suppressing it from expressing certain properties of the proteins
- In Physiology, a high grade fever can denature proteins such as enzymes
	- can alter cell metabolism leading to injury and death
	- persistent high temps can trigger apoptosis
- Also applicable to medical supplies and instruments
	- sterilzed to denature the proteins in bacteria thus destroying bacterial cell components

#### Alcohol

- Hyddrogen bonding occurs between amide groups in the secondary protein structure. 
- H bonding between side chains occurs in tertiary structure
- Both disrupted by addition of alcohol
	- alochol disrupts side chain inter molecular H bonding
	- new H bonds are now made between the protein molecule and the alcohol side chains
- Applicable in 70% alcohol for disinfecting the skin
	- this concentration is able to penetrate bacterial cell wall and destroy proteins and enzymes inside it
	- compared to a 95% alcohol solution which coagulates the proteins on the outside of the cell wall and prevents it from entering the cell
		- not an effective disinfectant for microorganisms

#### Acids and Bases
![[Screenshot_20220614-224553_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Disrupts salt-bridges held together by ionic charges
- a type of double replacement reaction occurs where the positive and negative ions in the salt chain partners with the negative and positive ions in the acid or base added
- Occurs in the digestive system
	- acidic stomach acid curdles the milk (coagulates
- Salt bridge - straightens an alpha helix structure
	- denaturation of salt bridge results in further straightening effect on the protein chain (as shown in illustration above)

#### Heavy metal salts
![[Screenshot_20220614-225134_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Denature proteins in same way as acids and bases
- disrupt ionic bonds (because they are ionic themselves)
- Salts of heavy metals (Pb+2, Cd+2, Hg+2...) high atomic masses
- The reaction of a heavy metal + protein usually leads to an insoluble metal protein salt.
- used for disinfecting stuff
	- Silver Nitrate
		- used to prevent gonorrhoea infections in the eyes of newborn infants
		- also used in the treatment of nose and throat infections
		- also to cauterize wounds
	- Mercuric salts
		- similar properties in preventing infections in wounds
- Used in reverse in cases of heavy metal poisoning
	- a person who has ingested a large quantity of heavy metal salt
	- fed protein such as milk or egg whites may be introduced to precipitate the poisonous salt. 
	- then emetic is given to induce vomiting of the poisonous salt

#### Reducing Agents
![[Screenshot_20220614-225840_Teams.jpg]]
- Disrupt disulfide bonds
- Disulfide bonds are made by oxidation of sulfide groups on cysteine
- different protein chains or loops within a single chain are held together by strong, covalent, disulfide bonds
- reducing agents act on any disulfide bonds
- hydrogen atoms from the reducing agent form a bond with the cysteine of the protein (image above)
