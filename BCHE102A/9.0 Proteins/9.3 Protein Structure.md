[[3.3.2 Proteins#^f88328|Protein structure in depth]]

### Primary
- The amino acids present in the protein also determine how the protein folds
- Any change within the amino acid sequence changes the protein
	- which changes the function
	- genetic mutations which cause alterations in the primary protein structures (leading to a cascade of changes throughout all structural forms) can make disorders such as
		- cystic fibrosis
		- sickle cell anemia
		- albinism

### Secondary
- folds happen due to the hydrogen bonding of the polypeptide chain between carboxyl groups and amino groups of the peptide bond.
- Segments of the protein may acquire their own local fold which is much simpler and usually takes the simple shape of the spiral or the extended shape - a loop 
- Alpha-helix
	- twisting into right handed screw
	- amino group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl group of the adjacent turn of the helix
- Beta pleated
	- polypeptide chains are stretched out beside one another and bonded by intermolecular hydrogen bonds
	- all polypeptide chains are stretched out into almost maximum extension and then laid side by side held together by intermolecular H bonds

### Tertiary
- further folding of the secondary structure
- structure stabilizers of secondary and tertiary
	- Disulfide bonds
	- Electrostatic interactions
	- Hydrogen bonds
	- Van der Waals
- Gives rise to "Fibrous" and "Globular" shapes
- Biologically active

### Quarternary
- Spatial arrangement of various tertiary structures
- 2 or more polypeptide chains

>Domains: Parts of the protein chain which have their own 3 dimensional fold and can be attributed to some function
