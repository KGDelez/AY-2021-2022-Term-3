## Peptides
- Short polymer of amino acids joined by peptide bonds and classified by number of amino acids in the chain
	- Dipeptide: two(2) amino acids
	- Tripeptide: 3 
	- Tetrapeptide: 4 (some references consider this to be polypeptide already)
	- Oligopeptide: few amino acids (2-20 residues)
	- Polypeptide: macromolecules with many amino acids
	- Protein: biological macromolecule containing at least 30-50 amino acids joined by peptide bonds. 
		-  is a polypeptide
	- Residues: individual amino acid units
