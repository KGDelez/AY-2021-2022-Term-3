## Zwitterions
![[Screenshot_20220621-094753_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Under physiological conditions an amino acid exists as a **zwitterion**
	- a molecule that has both positive and negative regions of charge
	- ==Net charge = 0==
> acid -> proton donor, pH below 7.0
> base -> proton acceptor, pH is above 7.0
- NH2 in amino acid on the left has a free electron pair -> can attract a proton/H+
- COOH (specifically OH) acts as the acid (proton donator) to NH2 (which acts as the base - proton acceptor)
	- ![[Screenshot_20220621-095226_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- the bond between O and H in COOH breaks and H+ goes to NH2 to become NH3+

## Isoelectric point (pI)
- pH at which the concentration of Zwitterion is maximum - net charge is zero
- Different amino acids have different isolectric points
- At isoelectric point - amino acids are not attracted towards an applied electric field because they carry net zero charge
> amphoteric nature -> can act as base or acid depending on certain conditions 
	- amino acids
		- change form depending on pH level of body
		- pH where they are in + form and pH where they are in - form
		- enzymes work in the pH where its amino acids are good in.
	- water

### Calculation 
- isoelectric point of Glycine
- ![[Screenshot_20220621-095904_Obsidian.jpg]]
- High H+ or hydronium ion concentration - Acid -> low pH 
- Low H+ -> high pH -> base

- pKa1 - is Alpha Carboxy -> 2.34 -> (pH - acidic)
- pKa2 - Alpha Amino -> 9.6 -> (pH - basic)
- pI -> 5.97
- ![[Screenshot_20220621-100944_Obsidian.jpg]]
- When strongly acidic (below 2.34 in the case of glycine) then it is protonated
	- H2N of glycine becomes H3N+
	- ![[Screenshot_20220621-100457_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Net charge is +1
- When in between 2.34 and 9.6
	- ![[Screenshot_20220621-100731_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Net charge is 0 -> zwitterion
	- What exact pH is it in zwitterion -> formula above
- When strongly basic (above 9.6 in the case of glycine) it becomes deprotonated in the COOH part or aciidic part
	- ![[Screenshot_20220621-100807_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Net charge -> -1
- EX. 
	- What is the main form of glycine if the pH is 0 -> A
	- If pH is 12 -> C
	- if pH is 7 -> zwitterion
		- but not at maximum
		- not sure what other parts are other than zwitterion (can be protonated or deprotonated) but most are zwitterion

### Practice Exercise

- L-lysine
- ![[Screenshot_20220621-101742_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- side chain has pKa
	- acidic -> basic
		- Amine is H3N+ -> loses H from COOH -> looses H from H3N+ (amine group) -> Loses H from Side chain (NH3 -> NH2)
	- ![[Screenshot_20220621-102326_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- only use the pKAs of where the zwitterion form is
	- pI = 9.87 
		- (8.95+10.79)/2
