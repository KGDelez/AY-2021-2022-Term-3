## Carbohydrates
### Describe a Carbohydrate Molecule
[[8.3 Carbohydrates#^97ca68]]
### Describe the function of carbohydrates
- structure
### A type of monosaccharide with 5 carbon molecules
- pentose
### A type of monosaccharide which has a carbonyl group attached to the first carbon
- aldose
### missing
### What is a chiral carbon
- when switching from fischer to haworth, chiral carbons increasae
	- C1 (the anomeric carbon) also becomes chiral 
### How do  you distinguish between the alpha and beta types of anomers?
- Alpha - opposite
- Beta - same
- Carbons
	- C1 -> OH
	- C5 -> C6 -> CH2OH
### Change in rotation of plane polarized light resulting from the equilibrium between cyclic anomers and the open-chain form of a sugar
- what are dextrorotatory and levorotatory molecules
- This is **Mutarotation**
- D and L sugars are stereoisomers particularly enantiomers

### Differentiate epimers, enantiomers, and diastereomers
- epimers
	- Not mirror images - have just 1 C different
- Diastereomers
	- 2 or more different Cs (to 3)
- Enantiomers
	- Enantiomers are a pair of molecules that exist in two forms that are mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed one upon the other.
### Classify the following carbohydrates by indicating the nature of the carbonyl group and the number of atoms present
