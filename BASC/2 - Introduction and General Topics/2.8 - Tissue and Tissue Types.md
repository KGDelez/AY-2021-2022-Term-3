## 4 Types of Tissues
* Epithelial Tissue: Sheet like tissues that form the lining of membranes, ducts, & glands
	- Squamous
	- Cuboidal
	- Colummar
	- Stratified
	- Pseudostratifiedd
	- Transitional
* Connective: Most abundant and widely distributed of all tissues in complex animals
	* Soft
		* Elastic
		* Collagenous
		* Areolar/loose
		* Reticular
	* Specialized
		* Adipose
		* Cartilage
		* Bone
		* Blood
* Muscular: Tissues capable of contraction - foreceful shortening of muscle fibers
	* Skeletal: Voluntary muscle, striated, attached to bones
	* Cardiac: Involuntary muscle, striated, myocardium of heart
	* Smooth: Involuntary muscle, non-striated, Arrector pili muscle (erection/raising of hair on skin)
		* Intestinal smooth muscle undergoes a form of contraction called peristalsis
* Nervous: Tissues which exert greatest control over the body's responsiveness
	* Neurons
	* Neuroglia
	* Microglia
	* Schwann cell/neurolemmocytes
	* Astrocytes
	* Oligodendrocytes

### Irritability
* The capability to respond to the environment (property of tissue)
