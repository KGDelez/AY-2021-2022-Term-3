> Reason why we don't raise chickens with turkeys
> 	Blackhead disease - **Histomonas meleagridis**
> 		damages cecal wall of bird and can damage liver
			Common earthworms are the host of this pathogen
		**Heterakis gallinarum** is a nematode parasite that lives in the cecum of some galliform birds
			often carries **Histomonas meleagridis**
			not as bad infection in chickens. May be fatal to turkeys though.
