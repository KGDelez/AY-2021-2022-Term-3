## Male Reproductive System (Mammals)
![[Screenshot_20220712-143201_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Consists of
	- pair of testes - produces sperm (or spermatozoa)
	- ducts - transport sperm to penis
	- glands - add secretions to sperm to make semen
- Entire system is in pelvic cavity
- Testicles/ pair of testes- hanging between legs of male
	- enveloped by the scrotal sac/scrotum
	- connected to a duct
- Accessory glands - produces swimming medium and source of nourishment for sperm
	- Prostate gland
	- Cowper's gland
	- Seminal Vesicles
- ### Testes
	- ![[Screenshot_20220712-143841_Teams.jpg]]
	- Sperm
		- need temperatures between **2 and 10 deg C** lower than body temp to develop
			- reason why testes is ahnging below the body in a bag of skin called the **scrotal sacs** (or **scrotum**)
			- evaporation or secretions from special glands can further reduce temperatures
	- **Descension of Testes**
		- Testes descend into scrotal sacs at birth
			- many animals including humans
		- Testes do not descend until sexual maturity
		- Testes only descend temporarily during breeding season
	- **Cryptorchid** (Cryptorchidism) - mature animal in which one or both testes have not descended
		- usually infertile
		- not viable to fertilize egg
		- **Monorchid** - One testes descended
		- **Bilateral Cryptorchidism** - both undescended
	- Scrotum 
		- thermoregulator of the testes
		- hot - looser scrotum
		- cold - closer to the body
	- #### Seminiferous Tubules
		- ![[Screenshot_20220712-144414_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Testes consist of these coiled tubes
		- also known as **sperm producing tubules**
		- Sperm are formed by **meiosis**
		- Cells lying between seminiferous tubules (**leydig cells**) produce male sex hormone **testosterone**
			- Testosterone responsible for production of male secondary sexual characteristics
		- **Epididymis** - Site of maturity of sperm cells
			- Humans - almost a month to make sperm mature
	- #### Passageway of Sperm
		- ![[Screenshot_20220712-144718_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- Urinary system very connected to the reproductive system
			- Male urethra is passageway for both sperm and urine
		- When sperm are matured they accumulate in the **collecting ducts**
			- then pass to the **epididymis**
			- then move to **sperm duct** or **vas deferens**
			- two sperm ducts join the **urethra** just below the bladder
				- urethra passes through the **penis** - transports both sperm and urine
			- SUMMARY - collecting ducts -> epididymis -> sperm duct/vas deferense -> urethra (penis)
		- **Ejaculation** - discharges semen from erect penis
			- brought about by contraction of epididymis, vas deferens, prostate gland, and urethra
			- semen - collective term for sperm cells with the secretions of accessory glands
			- if just urinated, there is chance that there is bacteria in the urethra
				- cleanest liquid produced by male is semen
			- **Cowper's gland** - cleans the urethra before release of ejaculation (janitor of the urethra)
				- produces **pre-ejaculate** 
- ### Accessory Glands
	- ![[Screenshot_20220712-145837_Teams.jpg]]
	- swimming medium for sperm
	- #### Seminal vesicles
		- Produce secretions that make up much of the volume of semen
		- transport and provide nutrients for sperm
		- Also has fructose - sweetest sugar 
			- 10 times more sweet than glucose
			- for sperm cell nourishment - allows to swim
				- allows to penetrate zona pellucida of the ovum
		- important in
			- rats
			- bulls
			- boars
			- stallions
		- Absent in
			- cats
			- dogs
	- #### Prostate gland
		 - Produces an alkaline secretion that neutralizes acidity of male urethra and female vagina
		 - Important in
			 - dogs
			 - humans
	- #### Cowper's glands (bulbourethral glands)
		- Various functions in different species
			-  secretions may
				- lubricate
				- flush out urine
				- form gelatinous plug that trams semen in reproductive system after copulation
					- also prevents other males of same species from fertilizing already mated female
		- Absent in
			- bears
			- aquatic mammals
	
- ### Sperm Cell
	- ![[Screenshot_20220712-150318_Obsidian 2.jpg]]
	- Has haploid chromosome (either x or y)
		- fertilized ovum is diploid
	- Three parts
		- Head - consists mainly of nucleus
		- Midpiece - contains many mitochondria 
			- provides energy
		- Tail
			- provides propulsion
	- #### Life Span
		- Definite lifespan that varies from species to species
		- Life span in epididymis
			- Guinea pig - 20 days
			- Bull - 60 days
		- Once ejaculated into female
			- live only from **12-48 hours**
	- #### Artificial insemination (AI)
		- has many advantages than disadvantages
		- have to collect semen from ejaculate of male
			- diluted with semen extender
			- stored until female is ready
		- storage under right conditions can extend life span of some species
		- Male can be artificially stimulated to ejaculate and collect semen
			- dilute, stored, and used to inseminate females
		- **Bull semen** can be diluted and stored for up to **3 weeks** at room temperature
			- if mixed with antifreeze solution and stored in "straws", in liquid nitrogen at -79C, will keep for much longer
		- **Semen of chickens, stallions, and boars** can only be stored for up to **2 days**
		- ##### Advantages of AI
			- Dilution of semen
				- more than one male can be used to fertilize many more females than would occur under natural conditions
			- Male and Females not having to make physical contact
				- possibility of transmitting STDs is reduced
			- Owners don't have to buy expensive males
			- High Quality Semen
				- Routine examination of semen for sperm concentration, quality, and activity allows only highest quality semen to be used
				- High success rate is ensured
		- ##### Proper Timing
			- Timing is crucial because 
				- lifespan of sperm in female tract is short
				- ova only survive from 8-10 hours
			- Successful conception depends upon detecting time that animal is 
				- "on heat"
				- and when ovulation occurs
