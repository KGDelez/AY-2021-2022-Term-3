## Mammalian Female Reproductive System
- ![[Screenshot_20220712-151645_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Consists of
	- pair of ovaries
		- produces egg cells or ova
	- fallopian tubes  
		- where fertilization occurs 
		- carry fertilized ovum to uterus
	- uterus
		- growth of fetus takes place here
	- cervix
		- separates the uterus from vagina or birth canal
	- vagina/birth canal
		- sperm is deposited here
- Release of ova
	- Uniparous - release of one ovum at a time
	- Multiparous - release of many ova at a time
		- dogs, pig, etc.
- ### Ovaries
	- ![[Screenshot_20220712-152040_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Small oval organs
	- in abdominal cavity just ventral to kidneys
	- Most animals have a pair of ovaries
		- !Except birds which only use left one (functional) to reduce weight
	- Consists of
		- Medulla - inner region
		- Cortex - outer region 
			- contains egg cells or ova
	- Egg cells or Ova
		- formed in large numbers around the time of birth
			- mammals already have all the egg cells when they are born 
			- unlike sperm cells where they produce after sexual maturity (puberty)
		- start to develop after animal becomes sexually mature
	- Follicle
		- cluster of cells that surrounds and nourishes each ovum
	- #### Ovarian Cycle
		- ![[Screenshot_20220712-152519_Obsidian.jpg]]
		- refers to the series of changes in the ovary during which 
			- the follicle matures
			- ovum is shed
			- corpus luteum develops
				- when fertilized, will stay and produce progesterone
				- sustain pregnancy
			- not pregnant
				- corpus luteum regresses -> becomes corpus hemorrhagicum -> menstruation
		- ##### Ovarian follicles
			- ![[Screenshot_20220712-152737_Obsidian.jpg]]
			- numerous undeveloped ovarian follicles are present at birth
				- only start to mature after sexual maturity
			- Animals that normally have one baby at a time
				- only one ovum matures at once
			- Litter animals
				- several ova mature at the same time
			- When pregnant
				- progesterone rises
				- estrogen decreases
			- Abnormality/not much progesterone
				- miscarriage
			- Mature follicle
				- can be quite large
					- few millimiters in small animals to as large as a golf ball in large animals
				- bulges out from surface of ovary before rupturing to release ovum into abdominal cavity
				- Once ovum is shed
					- blood clot forms in empty follicle
					- this develops into corpus luteum (progesterone producer)
					- pregnant - corpus luteum persists
					- no pregnancy - corpus luteum degenerates
						- new ovarian cycle begins
		- ##### Ovum
			- ![[Screenshot_20220712-153309_Obsidian.jpg]]
			- when shed, the nucleus is in final stages of meiosis (cell division)
			- surrounded by 
				- few layers of follicle cells
				- zona pellucida - tough membrane
