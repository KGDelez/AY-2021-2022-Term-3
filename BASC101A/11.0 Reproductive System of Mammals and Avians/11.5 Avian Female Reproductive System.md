## Avian Female Reproductive System
- ![[Screenshot_20220712-154231_Teams.jpg]]
- Have only one ovary - usually the **left**
	- left and right ovary develop embryonically as paired structures
	- but after hartching, right ovary and oviduct degenerate
	- IF left ovary is removed from chick before 30 days of age
		- remnants of right ovary will develop into ovitestis
		- may be capable of producing sperm
- Parts of the Female Reproductive system
	- Ovary - Egg yolk deposition
	- Infundibulum - Capture and fertilization of ovum
	- Magnum - Secretion of egg white proteins
	- Isthmus - Deposition of Eggshell membranes
	- Uterus - longest stay of egg - formation of eggshell
	- Vagina - Oviposition of egg
- produces extremely yolky eggs
- Eggs are fertilized in **upper part of oviduct**
	- equivalent to fallopian tube and uterus of mammals
- as eggs pass down it forms the following below and are laid over the yolk
	- **albumin** (white of egg)
	- membrane beneath shell
	- shell
- Egg is covered in layer of mucus to help bird lay it
- ### Formation of Egg in Hen
	- ![[Pasted image 20220712154638.png]]
	- Egg is formed gradually over a period of **25 hours**
	- Mature yolk - released when sac ruptures
	- received by funnel of left oviduct
	- left oviduct - coiled or folded tube around 80cm in length
		-  divided into 5 distinct regions with specific functions
- ### Parts of Chicken Egg
	- ![[Screenshot_20220712-154836_Obsidian.jpg]]
- Chalazae - hold yolk in center of egg
- Yolk - source of food for embryo and contains all the fat in the egg
	- as well as lecitihin emulsifier
- Germinal disc - small white spot on the yolk
	- where female's genetic material is found
- Albumen
	- no fat
	- water, protein, vitamin, minerals and some sulfur
