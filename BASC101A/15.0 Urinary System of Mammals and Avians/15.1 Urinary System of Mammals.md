## Urinary System of Mammals
![[Pasted image 20220629152944.png]]
- filters waste from blood
- forming and secreting urine
- these maintain the composition and volume of body fluids
- Parts
	- Kidney - produces urine
	- Ureter - urine -> urinary bladder
	- Urinary bladder - temporarily stores urine
	- Urethra - urine -> out of body
	- Renal artery - heart -> kidney (filters blood)
	- Renal vein - kidney -> heart (filtered blood)

- ### Kidneys 
	- ![[Pasted image 20220629153456.png]]
	- round/bean shaped
	- retro-peritoneally - outside the peritoneum 
		- peritoneum - membrane that encloses organs of the abdominal cavity
	- perirenal fat - surrounded by fat
	- capsulated - fibrous capsule covers
	- hilum - indentation of bean shape
		- where renal artery enters
		- renal vein and ureter exit
	> Cortex - outer layer
	> 	nephrons - functional unit of the kidney
	> 		1 million per kidney
	> Medulla - inner layer
	> 	tubular system structure
	> 		collecting duct
	> 		loop of henle
	> 		distal convuluted tubule 
	> 		collecting duct
	> urine -> calyx -> ureter -> urinary bladder
	
	- #### Cortex
		- outer part
		- where blood is actually filtered through =="glomeruli"==
	- #### Medulla
		- urine is concentrated through complex system of tubules
			- absorb water and electrolytes
			- prevent waste products from reabsoroption
	- #### Nephron
		- ![[Pasted image 20220629154438.png]]
		- ==nephron== = glomerulus + tubules
			- microscopic functional unit of kidney
		- Blood -> Renal artery (kidney)-> branching arteries -> smaller arteries (nephron) -> afferent arterioles (high pressure blood) -> branches into glomerulus -> efferent arteriole
			- glomerulus/glomerular capillaries - cluster of capillaries
			- Bowman's capsule - encapsulates glomerulus
		- High pressure in afferent arteriole + glomerulus 
			- causes water, glucose, amino acids, salts -> leave blood vessel and enter Bowman's capsule -> proximal tubule
		- Blood cell & proteins
			- too big to be filtered out -> exit through efferent arteriole
	- #### Tubules
		- Bowmans capsule -> tubules
		- tubules surrounded by capillaries 
			- capillaries get the reabsorbed material back into blood
		- proximal convoluted tubule -> loop of henle -> distal convoluted tubule -> collecting duct
		- ##### Proximal Convoluted Tubule
			- reabsorbed
				- 99% of water  
				- Glucose
				- amino acids
			- If glucose and/or amino acids not reabsorbed -> disease
				- diabetes - too much glucose so cannot reabsorb -> excreted in urine
		- ##### Loop of Henle
			- extends to medulla
			- more water and electrolytes (salts) reabsorbed here
		- ##### Distal Convoluted Tubule
			- Excess K+ ions ,H+ ions, some drugs or toxins -> passed from blood to filtrate
		- ##### Collecting Duct
			- Several nephrons empty to this
			- leads to ==papillae of pyramids -> calyxes -> renal pelvis -> ureter==
	- #### Ureter
		- Muscular tubes
		- Lined by transitional epithelium
		- urine: kidneys -> urinary bladder (opening at base of bladder)
		- peristaltic movement - propelling urine 
	- #### Urinary Bladder
		- ![[Pasted image 20220629155726.png]]
		- Sac for temporary storage of urine
		- located in pelvic cavity
		- covered with fibrous connective tissue (peritoneum)
			- inside is muscular layer -> detrusor muscle (smooth muscle)
				- contracts to expel urine from bladder
			- after detrusor -> submucosa (elastic fibrous membrane)
				- supports mucosa (lines inside of bladder)
			-  mucosa 
				- transitional epithelium
				- when bladder is empty, mucosa has folds called "rugae"
				- "rugae" and transitional epithelium -> allow for stretching when filled with urine
		- internal urethral sphincter 
			- regulates flow of urine
		- external urethral sphincter
	- #### Urethra
		- ![[Pasted image 20220629160024.png]]
		- Final passageway
		- thin walled
		- base of urinary bladder -> outside body
		- female - relatively short
			- connects bladder to external urethral sphincter
		- males - longer
			- passes through prostate gland (in animals which have)
			- travels length of penis -> external sphincter
