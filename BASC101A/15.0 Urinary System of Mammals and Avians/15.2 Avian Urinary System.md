- ![[Pasted image 20220629160227.png]]
- Almost all birds do not have bladder
	- ostrich has
- urine leaves ureters -> cloaca -> (revese peristalsis) large intestine (reabsorption of excess water) -> elimination
- known as "genitourinary system"
- uric acid -> with feces
- ### Kidneys
	- pelvic region
	- posterior ends joined
	- lobe shaped (lobulated)
	- short ureters that each open into the cloaca (not joined)
	- Urinary waste - semisolid uric acid -> cloaca with Feces
	- coprodeum - opening - feces passes out through this
	- proctodeum - opening - egg passes out through this
