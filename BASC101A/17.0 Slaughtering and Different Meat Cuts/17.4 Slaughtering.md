![[Pasted image 20220707155200.png]]
- after stunning, animals are usually suspended by the hindlimb and moved down a conveyor line for slaughter procedures
- exanguination (AKA sticking or being bled) 
	- insertion of knife into thoracic cavity 
	- severance of carotid artery and jugular vein
	- allows for maximal blood removal from body
- at this point, slaughtering procedure differs per species
> for cattle, removes fat (back fat)
> for pork, not remove back fat
