## Pre-slaughter handling
![[Screenshot_20220706-102920_Obsidian.jpg]]
- major concern esp pork industry
- stress applied to livestock before slaughter
	- undesirable effects on meat produced from animals
	- includes PSE (Pale, soft, exudative) and DFD (Dark, firm, Dry) (both bad)
- Pre-slaughter stress can be reduced by 
	- preventing the mixing of different groups of animals
	- keeping livestock cool with adequate ventilation
	- avoiding overcrowding
- Before slaughter, animals should be 
	- allowed access to water
	- but held off feed for 12-24 hrs 
		- assure complete bleeding (exanguination) and ease of evisceration (removal of internal organs)
