![[Pasted image 20220707154346.png]]
- major concern especially in pork industry
- Stress
	- can lead to undesirable effects on the meat
	- PSE (Pale, Soft, Exudative)
	- DFD (Dark, Firm Dry)
- Preslaughter stress can be reduced by
	- prevention of mixing of different groups of animals
	- keeping livestock cool with adequate ventilation
	- avoiding overcrowding
- Before slaughter
	- allowed access to water
	- held off feed for 12-24 hours to assure complete bleeding and ease of evisceration (removal of internal organs)
> Meat inspectors inspect here already
> 	should not be sick or sickly
> Pork is very sensitive to stress
> 	if pig is not well handled (refer to picture above)
> 	Adrenal glands release adrenaline and cortisol (also epinephrine)
> 	glycogen is used, lactic acid is released -> body hurts
> When transport - should have adequate space
> 	also has quarantine checkpoint
> If stressed, will make it less profitable for farm owners
