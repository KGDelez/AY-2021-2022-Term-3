- singular Alveolus
- Alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts
- Alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole and each duct ends in approx. 100 alveolar sacs
	- bronchiole -> alveolar ducts -> alveolar sacs
- Alveolar sacs
	- 20-30 alveoli 
		- alveoli 200-300 microns in diameter
- Alveoli are made up of thin-walled, parenchymal cells in direct contact with capillaries
	- ensures oxygen will diffuse from alveoli to the blood
	- ensures CO2 (waste product) will diffuse from the blood into alveoli -> exhaled
