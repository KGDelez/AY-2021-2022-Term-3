![[Screenshot_20220614-195517_Chrome.jpg]]
- Birds
	- have relatively small lungs
	- have 9 airsacs 
	- have lungs that do not inflate because of a lack of diaphragm and pleural cavity
	- also have pneumatic bones which contain air as well
- Gas exchange in birds occurs between air capillaries and blood capillaries, rather than in alveoli
