## Avian Air Sacs
![[Screenshot_20220614-195517_Chrome.jpg]]
- Air flows from the posterior airsacs to the lungs, and out of the anterior airsacs
	- posterior airsacs -> lungs -> anterior airsacs
	- opposite direction from blood flow
	- much more efficient gas exchange
		- allows birds to get the necessary oxygen even at higher altitudes
	- the directionality of airflow requires 2 cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get air out of the lungs (inhale - inhale - exhale (?))
