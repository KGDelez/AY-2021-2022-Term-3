- As air enters the lungs it is diverted into two primary bronchi
	- primary bronchi -> secondary bronchi -> tertiary bronchi -> bronchioles
	- bigger -> smaller diameters
	- bronchi
		- made of cartilage and smooth muscle
		- innervated by nerves of both parasympathetic (contraction) and sympathetic (relaxation) nervous systems
	- bronchioles
		- made of elastic fibers (rather than cartilage) and smooth muscle
