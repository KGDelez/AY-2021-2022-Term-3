- Air has particulates that can damage the lungs
	- dust
	- dirt
	- viral particles
	- bacteria
- In the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap the particulates to prevent entry
- if make it beyond nose/enter through mouth
	- bronchi & bronchioles
		- have cilia - small hair-like projections that line the walls
			- move mucus and particles aout of the bronchi and bronchioles back up the throat
			- mucus & particulates may be swallowed or spat out
	- lungs
		- (Goblet cells) produce mucus that traps particulates
