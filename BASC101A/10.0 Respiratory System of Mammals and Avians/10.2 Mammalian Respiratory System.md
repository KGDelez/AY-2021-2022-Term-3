## Mammalian Respiratory System
- Pulmonary ventilation
	- occurs via inhalation
		- air enters the body through nasal cavity
			- warmed to body temperature
			- humidified
- Protective Mechanisms of the Respiratory System (prevent damage to trachaea and lungs)
	- Respiratory tract is coated with mucus which is high in water
		- this mucus seals the tissues from direct contact with the air
	- When air passes through the respiratory tract, it picks up water from the surfaces of the mucous membranes
		- equilibriates the air to the body
			- reduces damage that cold, dry air can cause
	- Particulates are removed in nasal passages
		- elimitated to the pharynx with mucuous
			- either swallowed or extruded
