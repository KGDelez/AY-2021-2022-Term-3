## Lymphatic System
- a network of vessels that run throughout the body
- do not form full circulating system
- not pressurized by heart
- open system with fluid moving in one direction
	- from extremities toward 2 drainage points into veins just above heart
- lymphatic fluids move more slowly than blood
	- because unpressurized
- small lymph capillaries interact with blood capillaries in the interstitial  (missing) 32:00
- ### Lymphoid tissue 
	- ![[Screenshot_20220627-105529_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Two types:
		- #### Primary Lymphoid
			- bone marrow
				- contains hemtopoeitic stem cells (HSC)
					- differentiate and mature into various blood cells and lymphocytes
				- if T lymphocytes cant be produced by normal producer (WHO IS NORMAL PRODUCER) bone marrow takes over
			- thymus
		- #### Secondary Lymphoid
			- spleen
			- lymph nodes
			- diffuse lymphoid tissues
			- underlying epithelial membranes
	- #### Spleen
		- encapsulateed structure
		- filters blood
		- captures pathogens and antigens
		- contains specialized macrophages and dendritic cells 
			- crucial for antigen presentation 
			- crucial (missing (35:00))
	- #### Lymph nodes
		- bean shaped organs througout body
		- contain germinal centers
			- rich in B and T lymphocytes
		- also contain macrophages and dendritic cells for antigen presentation
