## Cardiovascular system
![[Screenshot_20220627-103559_Obsidian.jpg]]
- closed network of organs and vessels that move blood around the body
- primary purpose: deliver nutrients, immune factors, and oxygen to tissues and to carry away waste products for elimination
	- oxygen - carried by hemoglobin 
- ### Heart
	- ![[Screenshot_20220627-103724_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- four chambered pump that propels blood throughout the body
	- Parts
		- Right Atrium/Auricle
		- Left Atrium/Auricle
		- Right Ventricle
		- Left Ventricle
	- Connected to Heart
		- Superior venacava
		- Inferior Venacava
		- Aortic Arch
		- Pulmonary arteries
- ### Blood Circulation
	- ![[Screenshot_20220627-104346_Obsidian.jpg]]
	- Deoxygenated blood in superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (from the body) -> Right atrium -> tricuspid valve -> right ventricle -> heart contracts -> pulmonary arteries -> lungs -> blood is oxygenated at alveoli -> pulmonary veins -> left atrium -> mitral valve -> left ventricle -> heart cotnracts -> oxygenated blood goes through the body through arteries -> arterioles -> capillaries/capillary beds in interstital spaces within tissues -> unoxygenated blood -> venules -> veins -> superior and inferior vena cava -> right atrium
	- largest artery - aorta
	- largest veins - superior and inferior vena cava
	- arteries
		- carry oxygenated blood (except pulmonary arteries)
	- veins
		- carry deoxygenated blood (except pulmonary veins)
	> blood is connective tissue
- #### Other organs involved
	- Kidneys - filter blood, removing waste products and eliminating them in urine
	- Liver - filters blood and removed damaged or defective RBC
		> hepatomegaly - why?
	- Spleen - filters and stores blood, removes damaged RBC, and is a reservoir for immune factors
		> splenomegaly - enlargement of the spleen (why?)
		
	- all these serve as sites for entrapment of microorganisms and help maintain an environment free of microorgansims in blood
