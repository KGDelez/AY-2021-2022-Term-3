## Breeding true
- Animals of the "same breed" when bred together are known as "breeding true"
	- this is because they pass on the selected traits predictably to their offspring

## Crossbreeds or Mixed Breeds
- when an animal of one breed is bred with an animal from another breed

## Hybrids
- these are when animals create offspring above the level of breed (species, subspecies, genera)
