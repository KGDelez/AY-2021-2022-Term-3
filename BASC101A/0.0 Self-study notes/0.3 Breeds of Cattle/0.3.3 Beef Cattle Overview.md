## Beef Cattle
- raised for meat production
- Meat = beef
- Though mainly for beef/meat production, other uses are leather as well as shampoo and cosmetic products

### 3 stages of beef production
- Cow-calf operations
	- A permanent herd of cows is kept by the farmer or rancher which produces calves for meat sales
- Backgrounding
	- making a cow graze on pasture or veld (open country which has grass, bushes, or shrubs or are thinly forested) and feeding it supplements in preparation for more intensive feeding in a feedlot
- Feedlot operations (or feed yard)
	- an **Animal Feeding Operation (AFO)** that is used for intensive animal farming for finishing livestock, laregely beef cattle.
	- When raised here, the cattle are known as **feeder cattle**
		- many are born in cow-calf operations specifically for producing beef cattle
