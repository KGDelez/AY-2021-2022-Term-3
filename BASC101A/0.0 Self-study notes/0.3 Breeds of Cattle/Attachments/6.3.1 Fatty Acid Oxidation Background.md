## Fatty Acid Oxidation Background

- ### Oxidation-reduction reaction (AKA redox reactions)
	- reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another
	- the species that loses electrons -> oxidized
	- species which gains electrons -> reduced
- ### Fatty Acid Oxidation
	- 
	- Omega-3 Fatty acids are particularly high in fish oils
	- fatty acids are also very susceptible to oxidation
	- oxidation causes a strong, rancid odor, as the fats are **converted into smaller molecules like ==aldehydes==**
