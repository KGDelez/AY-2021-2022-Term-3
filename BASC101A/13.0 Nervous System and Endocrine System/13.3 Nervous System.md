## Nervous System 
![[Pasted image 20220622151019.png]]
- two parts:
- ### Central Nervous System (CNS)
	- Brain and Spinal Cord
	- ![[Screenshot_20220622-151106_Chrome.jpg]]
	- Brain
		- Cerebellum - little brain
		- pons
		- medulla
	- make the center of the body's communication system
	- processes every sensation and thought the animal experiences
	- Receptors throughout the body gather sensory information and pass it on to the CNS
	- also sends messages to the rest of the body to control movement, actions, and responses to the environment
- ### Peripheral Nervous System
	- composed of nerves that extend beyond the CNS
	- neural networks of the PNS are actually **bundles of axons** from neuron cells
		- bundles range from small to large enough for the human eye to see
	- #### Somatic Nervous System
		- transmits sensory communications
		- responsible for **voluntary movement and action**
		- composed of **sensory (afferent) neurons** and **motor (efferent) neurons**
			- Sensory neurons -> carry info from the nerves to the brain and spinal cord
			- Motor neurons -> transmit information from the CNS to the muscle fibers
	- #### Autonomic Nervous System
		- controls involuntary functions
			- heartbeat
			- respiration
			- digestion
			- blood pressure
		- involved in emotional responses
			- sweating
			- crying
		- ##### Sympathetic Nervous System
			- controls body's response to an emergency
			- when this system is triggered
				- heart rate increases
				- breathing rate increases
				- digestion slows or stops
				- pupils dilate
				- sweat
			- Also known as the **fight or flight response**
				- prepares the body to confront danger or to avoid it
		- ##### Parasympathetic Nervous System
			- balances the Sympathetic NS. 
			- after crisis or danger has passed, it helps calm body by
				- slowing heart rate
				- slowing breating rate
				- resuming digestion
				- contracting pupils
				- stop sweating
