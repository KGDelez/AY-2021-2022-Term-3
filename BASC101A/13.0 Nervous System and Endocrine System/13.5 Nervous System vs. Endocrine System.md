## Nervous System vs. Endocrine System
| Nervous System                                     | Endocrine System                                                                                                                                         |

| Messengers: Electrical Impulses                                                 | Messengers: Hormones are chemical messengers that target cells through the blood stream                                                   |
| Brain and Spinal Cord                                  | Glands and organs like thyroid, pituitary glands, reproductive organs (ovaries and testes) are involved                                                                                            |
| Nerve impulses are transmitted through neurons                                | Hormones are transmitted through blood vessels                                                                                             |
| The nervous system is under both voluntary and involuntary control                          | Under involuntary control                         |
| Nerve impulses make use of neurotransmitters at synaptic clefts and sodium & potassium channels and enter the target cells                                            | Hormones enter the target cells by diffusing through the plasma membrane or by binding to the cell receptors                                                                                                                           |
| Responses are localized | Responses are widespread |

>ovaries -> progesterone or estrogen(?) and testes -> testosterone
