## Layers of the Skin
![[Pasted image 20220523105530.png]]
- **Epidermis** - outer ==avascular== epithelial
- **Dermis** - inner layer and consists of ==dense irregular connective tissue==

### Epidermis 
- keratinized stratified squamous epithelium

##### Layers
- Stratum Corneum (topmost - most superficial)
- Stratum Lucidum (only on thick skin - often in hairier parts)
- Stratum Granulosum
- Stratum Spinosum
- Stratum Basale (bottommost - most deep)

##### Stratum Corneum (Horny Layer)
- outermost layer
- several layers of keratinized dead cells constantly being shed
- varies in thickness in different areas of body and between species
- appears clear and has ==no nuclei or cytoplasmic organelles==

##### Stratum Lucidum (clear layer)
- only found in thick skin and hairless regions
- thin transluscent homogenous line between granulosum and corneum


##### Stratum Granulosum (granulated layer)
- several layers of flattened cells
- has ==keratohyalin granules== and ==lamellar granules==

##### Stratum Spinosum
- layers of irregular polyhedral (spiny) cells
- Contains ==tonofilaments== more prominent than in stratum basale
- Can undergo cell division as because they are living cells

##### Stratum Basale (basal layer)
- Single layer of ==columnar or cuboidal== cells resting on ==basal lamina==

##### Stratum Germinativum
- stratum basale + stratum spinosum but can also be just stratum basale
- Germ -> means alive
- Reason why they keep undergoing cell division 
	- cells in the upper layers keep getting replaced because they keep sloughing off.

### Dermis (Corium)

- True Skin
-  beneathe basement membrane until the hypodermis
- divided into 
	- papillary layer - thinnest layer, Loost CT, in contact with epidermis and conforms to contour of Stratum Basale
	- Reticular layer - thicker layer, dense irregular CT, smooth muscle (arrector pili) muscle near hair follicle
