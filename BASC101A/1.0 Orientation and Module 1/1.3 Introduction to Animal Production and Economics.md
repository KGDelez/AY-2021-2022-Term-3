### Overview

- breeds
	- think about what breed is suitable for the environment
- Nutrition
	- If they need nutritious things then they would have less problems with health
	- When they reach the kitchen then they will also be healthy for us
- Health
	- problems in parasitism
- Housing and Management
	- Follow spacing guidelines
		- for them to be able to grow well in given env
	- management 
		- sanitation
		- waste management

- all have to be cosidered when in animal production

### Global Challenge

- safe
- affordable
- and enough

### Reasons for the Global Challenge
- Increasing human population thus -> Reduction of areas for agricultural production -> Increasing challenge to produce more animal food products

- reduction of areas for agricultural production
	- Before farm land have become residential areas

### Animals and their economic utility

- Economic utility
	- the attribute of animals that enhances the ability of an agricultural system to produce food for men
	- E.g.
		- Animals can feed on and convert plants and other materials (which may be waste) into rich human food
			- "waste": rice hulls for example
		- Animal products have chemical composition that resembles man's dietary requirements
			- is thus more digestible and nutritious
				- ex. animal protein more digestible and nutritious than plant protein (?)

### Man, Animal, and Ecological System

- limit use of antibiotics 
	- withdrawal period if not observed becomes a reason for antibiotic resistance in people (livestock animals)

### Inter-relationship of the components of an ecosystem

- good source of plant proteins will make the animals healthy as well. And as we eat the animals they are a good source of animal protein
