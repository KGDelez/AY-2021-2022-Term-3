## Muscles Overview
- Muscles Contract (shorten) to move the bone attached at the joint
- Skeletal muscles are attached to bones
	- arranged in opposing groups around joints
- Muscles are innervated
	- nerves condunct electrical currents from the Central Nervous System that cause the muscles to contract
> Skelatal muscle forms the shape of the animal
> When muscles move heat is also produced
> 	we sweat or dogs pant
- ==Only Skeletal and Smooth muscles are considered part of the musculoskeletal System==
### 3 types of muscle tissue

> call muscle fibers as skeletal muscle cells

- #### Smooth Muscle ^dd2d99
	- Spindle-shaped
	- nonstriated
	- uninucleated
	- Occurs in walls of internal organs
	- Involuntary - controlled by the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
- ### Skeletal Muscle ^47e2da
	- Striated
	- tubular
	- multinucleated
	- usually attached to skeleton
	- is voluntary - controlled by the Central Nervous System (CNS)
- #### Cardiac Muscle
	- Striated
	- branched
	- uninucleated
	- have intercalated disks
	- occurs in walls of heart
	- involuntary - controlled by the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
> synchronous movement (syncitial action)
> should not tire of contraction because animal will die
