## Skin Appendages
- mammalian skin -> hair
- Birds -> feathers
- Fish & reptiles -> scales
- Pigment in skin, hairs or feathers can make outer surface many colors
- Reptiles, birds, mammals -> nails claws at the end of toes
	- many uses

### Hair
![[Pasted image 20220523111334.png]]
- flexible, keratinized structure produced by hair follicle (dead, just keep adding from hair follicle)
- Parts:
	- Hair Shaft
	- Hair Root
	- Hair Bulb
- Follicle - small secretory cavity, sac, or gland
- Shaft 
- (missing)

### Glands
- Sebaceous glands - secrete oily secretion into hair follicle known as ==sebum== - keeps hair supple and prevents bacterial growth
	- ![[Pasted image 20220523111453.png]]
- Sweat glands - coiled tube and duct
	- ![[Pasted image 20220523111608.png]]
	- contains salt and waste like urea
	- evapration of sweat on the skin is one of the major mechanisms for cooling of the body of many mammals
- Mammary Glands
	- ![[Pasted image 20220523111738.png]]
	- Only present in Mammals
	- modified sebaceous glands 
		- present in both sexes but rarely active in males
	- number of glands varies from species to species
	- open to surface in well-developed nipples
	- milk contains
			- proteins
			- sugars
			- fats
			- salts
		- Exact compostion varies from one species to another

### Hoof
- sheep cows horses etc also known as ==ungulate mammals==
	- animals that have lost toes in the process of evolution and walk on the "nails" of the remaining toes
- hoof is a cylinder of horny material that surrounds and protects tip of toe
- ![[Pasted image 20220523112057.png]]
- Pig - two toes
- Cows, sheep - one toe

### Horns
#### True Horns
- made of keratin and found in ==sheep, goats, cattle==
- never branched
- doesnt shed once grown
- (research)

#### Antlers
- Not formed in epidermis but consist of bone
- shed each year and often branched esp in older animals
- When growing covered in velvet 
- (missing)

### Feathers
![[Pasted image 20220523112420.png]]
- Feathers
	- Large airfoils for flapping and gliding flight
- Keratin based
- Light down feathers
	- some of best natural insulators
	- maintains high body temp of birds
