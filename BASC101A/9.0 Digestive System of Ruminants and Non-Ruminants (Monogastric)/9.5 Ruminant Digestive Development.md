## Ruminant Digestive Development
- Immature ruminants
		- Young calves from 2-3 months of age
	- functionally non-ruminants
	-  reticular groove (also known as esophageal groove) is formed by muscular folds of the reticulum
		- shunts milk direction to the omasum -> abomasum (bypassing reticulorumen)
	- rumen
		- inoculated with rumen microorganisms through mature ruminants licking calves and environmental contact with these
			- bacteria
			- fungi
			- protozoa
