- Ruminants uses its mouth and tongue to harvest forages during grazing or consume harvested feedstufs
	- wrap tongues around the plants (**prehensile organ**)
	- pull to tear the forage for eating
- Cattle can take from 25,000 to more than 40,000 prehensile bites to harvest forage each day
- Spend more than 1/3rd of time grazing, 1/3 time ruminating (cud chewing), and less than 1/3 idling (neither grazing nor ruminating)
- Food pathway: mouth -> Rumen -> Reticulum -> mouth -> omasum -> abomasum
