## The Ruminant Stomach
![[Pasted image 20220614161235.png]]
- one stomach with 4 compartments
	- rumen - 2nd most anterior
	- reticulum - most anterior part
	- omasum - 3rd most anterior
	- abomasum - most posterior
		- considered equivalent to the true stomach of the non-ruminant
- Occupies almost 75 percent of the abdominal cavity - filling nearly all of the **left side** and extending significantly on the right side
- Relative sizes of the 4 stomach compartments (by volume)
	- rumem + reticulum = 84%
	- omasum = 12%
	- abomasum = 4%
- Rumen - Largest stomach compartment
	- can hold up to 40 gallons of digesta in mature cow

### Reticulum
![[Pasted image 20220614161323.png]]
- Most anterior part
- called the "honeycomb" because of honeycomb appearance of lining
- Sits underneath and toward the front of the rumen, lying against the diaphragm
- Ingesta flows freely between the reticulum and rumen
- The main function: **collect smaller digesta particles and move them to omasum**; 
	- larger particles remain in rumen for further digestion
		- from the rumen it goes to the mouth for further chewing (regurgitation) and become finer parts
- Can also trap and collect heavy/dense objects the animal consumes
	- such as nails, wire, or sharp heavy objects
		- when sharp, this can penetrate the reticulum wall during normal digestive tract contractions 
		- these objects can make their way to the heart - **hardware disease**
- Also sometimes referred to as "**hardware stomach**"

### Rumen
![[Pasted image 20220614161907.png]]
- inverted rumen
- also sometimes called the "paunch"
- Lined with **papillae** for nutrient absorption.
- Divided by muscular pillars into 
	- Dorsal sac
	- Ventral sac
	- Caudodorsal sac
	- Caudoventral sac
- Acts as a fermentation vat by hosting microbial fermentation
- 50-65 percent of starch and soluble sugar consumed is digested in the rumen
- Rumen microorganisms (primarily bacteria)
	- digest cellulose from plant cell walls
	- digest complex starch
	- synthesize protein from non-protein nitrogen (NPN)
	- synthesize B vitamins and Vitamin K
		- dont need B complex
- Rumen pH: 6.5-6.8 (Slightly Acidic)
- Rumen environment is **anaerobic** (without oxygen)
- Gases produced in the rumen (either removed from the stomach through flatulence or burping)
	- carbon dioxide
	- methane
	- hydrogen sulfide

### Omasum
![[Pasted image 20220614162616.png]]
- spherical in shape
- connected to the reticulum by a short tunnel
- Called "many piles" or "butcher's bible" in reference to many folds or leaves that resemble pages of a book
	- folds increase surface area
		- increases the area that absorbs (partial) nutrients from feed and water 
			- final absorption of nutrients is in small intestine
- Water absorption occurs here (partial)
	- final absorption/reabsorption of water is in large intestine
- Cattle have a highly developed, large omasum

### Abomasum
![[Pasted image 20220614162940.png]]
- "true stomach" as it is the glandular stomach (same as monogastrics/non ruminants)
- Produces
	- hydrochloric acid
	- digestive enzymes
		- pepsin (breaks down proteins)
- Receives
	- digestive enzymes from pancreas
		- pancreatic lipase (breaks down fats)
- Above secretions help prepare proteins for absorption in the intestines
- The pH ranges from **3.5 - 4.0** (acidic)
- **Chief Cells** in abomasum secrete **mucous** (mucin - counters effect of hydrochloric acid) to protect abomasal wall from acid damage



### True Ruminants
- Cattle
- Sheep
- Goats
- Deer
- Antelope
