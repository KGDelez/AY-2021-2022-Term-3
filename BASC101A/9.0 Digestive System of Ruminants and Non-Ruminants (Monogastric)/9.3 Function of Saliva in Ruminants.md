## Functions of Saliva in Rumnants
- Aids in
	- chewing
	- swallowing
- Contains enzmes for
	- breakdown of fat (salivary lipase)
	- breakdown of starch (salivary amylase)
		- Thus partial digestion of fat and starch in mouths
- Involved in [nitrogen recyling ](https://u.osu.edu/beef/2019/11/06/cattle-saliva-more-than-just-spit/)to the rumen (and even in reticulum)
- Most important function
	- **buffer pH levels in reticulum and rumen**
- Production:
	- Mature cow produces up to 50 quarts of saliva per day, but this varies depending on the amount of time chewing feed (the cud)
		- chewing feed stimulates saliva production
