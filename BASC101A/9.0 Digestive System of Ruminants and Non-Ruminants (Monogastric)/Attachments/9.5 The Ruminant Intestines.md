## The Ruminant Intestines
- small and large intestines follow abomasum
- further sites of nutrient absorption
### Small Intestine
- a tube up to 150 ft. long in a mature cow
- 20 gallon capacity in a mature cow
- Digesta entering small intestine mix with secretions from **the pancreas and liver**
	- this elevates the pH from 2.5 to between **7 an 8**
		- higher pH is needed for enzymes to work properly
- Bile from gall bladder is secreted into first section of small intestine (duodenum) to aid in digestion
	- bile produced in liver, stored in gall bladder
	- digests fat
	- horses do not have a gall bladder ^9f1ebe
- Active nutrient absorption occurs throughout the small intestine
	- includes [rumen bypass proteins](https://www.feedvalid.eu/en/productattribute/product-group/rumen-bypass-proteins/) absorption
- Intesinal wall - has numerous finger-like projections called "villi" 
	- increase intestinal surface area to aid in nutrient absorption
- Muscular contractions (peristaltic movement)- aid in mixing digesta and moving it to next section (large intestine)
- Parts:
	- duodenum
	- ileum
	- jejunum

### Large Intestine
- Absorbs water from digesta 
- Excretes remaining material as feces from the rectum
- Cecum - large blind pouch at beginning of LI
	- approx 3ft long with 2 gallon capacity in mature cow
	- serves little function in ruminants
	- but serves much more in horses
- Colon - site of most of the water absorption in LI
- Appendix - in anterior part of LI
