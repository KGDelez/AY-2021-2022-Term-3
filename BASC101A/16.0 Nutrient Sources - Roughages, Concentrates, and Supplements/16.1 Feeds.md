## Feeds
- materials consumed by animals that contribute energy and nutrients (or both) to the diet.
- this constitute a large portion of expenses in any livestock enterprise
	- as much as 80% in swine and poultry production
		- higher and it's not profitable (lugi na)
- knowledge of feeds and feed stuff such as when and how to use them for different species and classes of farm animals is important for those engaged in livestock and poultry production
> if you make your own feed - should still be below 80%
> if local made/materials - better
> but these days raw mat is not much in the Phil
> 	specifically concentrates and supplements
