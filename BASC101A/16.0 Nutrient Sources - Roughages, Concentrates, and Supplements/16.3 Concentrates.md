## Concentrates
 ![[Pasted image 20220709170420.png]]
- rich in energy and/or protein but low in fiber
- Examples
	- corn (kernel, not cob or husk)
	- soybean meal
	- oats
	- wheat
	- molasses
	- etc.
- High in energy value, including:
	- fat
	- cereal grains and byproducts (without husk)
		- barley
		- corn
		- oats
		- rye
		- wheat
	- high protein oil meals or cakes
		- soybean
		- canola
		- cottonseed
		- peanut (groundnut)
	- and byproducts from processing of
		- sugar beets
		- sugar cane
		- etc.
- Feeds that are high in nitrogen-free extract (NFE) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) and low in crude fiber (**less than 18%**) are considered concentrates
- ### Feeding concentrates
	- cereal grains play most important role
		- provide bulk of energy
		- large portion of dietay protein
		- low in fiber 
		- highly digestible by all livestock species
	- Non-ruminants (poultry and swine)
		- bulk of ration consists of highly digestible cereal grains
	> very important cereal grains for ruminants especially the young who need milk
	> 	concentrates, then molasses
	> 	because if they graze (grass), they have a lot of roughage already (already have high fiber portion of feed)
	> 	they need a source of protein
	> Ruminants -> bulk roughage
	> Non-ruminants -> bulk concentrates
