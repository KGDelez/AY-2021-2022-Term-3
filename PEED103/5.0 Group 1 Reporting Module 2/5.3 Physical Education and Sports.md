## Physical Education and Sports
Physical Education and Sport (PES) in school is the main societal institution for the development of physical skills and the provision of physical activity in children and young people. For many children, school is the main environment for being physically active, through either PES programs or after-school activities. (Richard Bailey, 2006 Journal of School Health)

Young individuals who participate in organised sport demonstrate lower rates of anti-social behaviour which may result in less disaffection from school

Physical education, physical activity and sport have been shown to impact positively on the extent to which young people feel connected to their school; the aspirations of young people; the extent to which positive social behaviours exist within school; and the development of leadership and citizenship skills. (Loughborough University – Lit Review 2010)

Their purpose is to optimize quality of life through a long-term commitment to enjoyable physical activity and sport experiences that will meet varied needs in a changing world.

“Sports Specialist schools in the UK have recorded the fastest rates of academic improvement (5+ A –C incl English & Maths) of all UK schools for the past 3 years.”

“Clearly, the rest of the school has something to learn from what is happening in the PE department”
