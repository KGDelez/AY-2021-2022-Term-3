## Differences among Sport, Games, and Play
- _Play_
	-  may not be serious, free activity standing outside ordinary life, may be intense depending on participants, absorbing, no material interest, has its own boundaries and/or limitations, can form through social groups and engaged in freely, fun, and lacking of restrictions.

- _Games_ 
	- somewhat more organized than play and has playful elements but explicit rules, boundaries which can be flexible, the sequence of actions are essentially repeatable. Generally, rules are agreed upon by participants prior to beginning, usually implying winners and losers, can range from simple diversions to competitions with significant outcomes governed by rules.

- _Sport_ 
	- is an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature. Hence, a sport can be a game, but a game is not necessarily a sport.  Merely competing does not make something a sport.  The key difference is that a sport implies not just activity, but athletic activity.
