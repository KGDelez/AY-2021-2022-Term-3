## Material Self
- heard from William James (link)
- covers:
	- material things we possess, 
	- the places we are associated with, 
	- the place we live in, 
	- the family we belong to, 
	- the community we belong to
- But mostly the material items are what we consider the material self
- =="Humans tend to keep things"==
	- even when clothes dont fit us any more
	- or the item is broken
	- or it's old
	- we tend to keep them

### Reasons why we keep things:
- Sentimental value - "Memories"
- Sunk Cost - sayang
- Depends on if its expensive or cheap - might be harder to let go of expensive things

### Reasons why we let things go
- doesn't serve its purpose anymore
- Marie Kondo method - does not give me joy anymore

> We each have our own reasons as to why we don't or do let things go
