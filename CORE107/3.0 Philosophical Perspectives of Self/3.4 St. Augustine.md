### St. Augustine
- two realms 
	- intelligible and sensibkle - truth dwells
	- human (soul)
	- both strive to have union with God (eternal)
- Man is created by God and is thus good
	- Our will and reason is directed to God to find its perfection
- Physical body is different from immortal soul 
	- inhabitant; superior over the body
- Body as the "spouse" of the soul with both attached to one another by a "natural appetite". The body is united with the soul, so that man may be entire and complete
	- Soul strives to be in union with God
- "I am doubting therefore I am"
	- doubting - meaning also thinking 
	- regarding soul "doubting that the soul exists therefore it does"
	- Rene Descartes might have pulled from St. Augustin
		- "I think therefore I am"
		- same thoughts but different contexts

- Plato and Augustine really tried to connect with Socrates
	- the human body is not that valuable as our self is the soul
		- or what is not physical (transcendental)
	- The soul must go out of the Physical body as it limits the self
	- Our true nature is in the world of ideas
