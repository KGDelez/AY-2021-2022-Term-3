## Philosophical Perspective of Self
* Philosophy 
	* Literally means "love of wisdom"
	* A search for a general understanding of values and reality by chiefly speculative rather than observational means
	* An analysis of the grounds of concepts expressing fundamental beliefs
	* Tim's answer: dwell more on the question rather than the answer
	* **Teacher's answer**
		* Philos/Philia - love
		* Sophia - wisdom
		* science of all things of its first causes known in the light of reason
		* cause/origin of self, understanding the cause/origin of self

- Socrates -> Plato -> Augustine 
	- matter (material object in reality) and form (mind) is different
		- "Form" - capital letter f
	- separate and exist away from each other

- Socrates -> Aristotle -> Aquinas
	- matter and form need each other to exist 
		- "form" - small letter f
	- matter and form coexist

- Socrates thinks there is a physical form and a transcendental form
