### Hume
- empiricist (vs Descartes- rationalist)
- he concludes that the idea of the self is simply fiction -> there is no self
- If we are self conscious, we are only aware of fleeting thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, we do not have an impression of the self or a thinking substance
	-  the self is a product of our feelings, impressions in our mind
- no simple or unified self that exists rather self is just the thing to which all perceptions of a man is ascribed
- bundle theory of mind ("Self")
