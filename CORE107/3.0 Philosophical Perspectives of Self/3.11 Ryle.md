### Ryle
- behaviorist
- affirms that mind is not separate from the body
- the mental states must always translate into physical actions
- the only way we know what people have on their minds is because they behave in a certain way. In that sense, the mind is nothing other than the dispositions of people to behave according to what they know, how they feel, what they desire, and so on
- The Self is How You Behave - self is bodily behaviour
