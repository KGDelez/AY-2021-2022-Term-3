### St. Thomas
- People - material substances whose souls emerge from the unified relationship of form and prime matter
- Life - inseperable union of matter and form
	- without matter the soul will remain abstract (the idea of a table vs. a physical table)
- Soul (latin: anima) - principle of life which distinguishes living from non-living
- Soul is responsible for the kind of body we have
	- the body is essential to our existence
