#### [Emmanuel Kant's Philosophy of the Self](https://youtu.be/rNtrwtyJxb0)
- Self is a subject, an organizing principle that makes a unified and intelligible experience possible
- Self is responsible for synthesizing the discreet data of sense experience into a meaningful whole
- Self is organizing all our sensations and thoughts into a picture that will make sense to us
- Self is a product of reason
