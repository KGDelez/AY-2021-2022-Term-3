### Aristotle
- Soul is what distinguishes living from non-living
	- a principle of life
	- human person is a **rational animal/animal that thinks**
- A soul can be 
		- rational, (all of the below + reason and reflection)
		- vegetative, or - plants (reproduction and growth)
		- sensitive - animal (reproduction, mobility, and sensation, and growth)
	- All living things have soul (even plants)
- Matter (Gk. hyle); Form (Gk. - morphe) = hylomorphism
	- human being have life because matter and form combine
- Human person 
	- soul is the form of the body
	- The soul and body cannot be separated into discrete existence, they only exist in relation to one another
	- life of the body is attributed to the soul
	- they need to be in union with one another
