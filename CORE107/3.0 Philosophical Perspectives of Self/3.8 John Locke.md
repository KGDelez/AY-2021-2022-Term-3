### John Locke
- **Self = memory**
- a person is a thinking being capable of reason and reflection
- Self is not tied in any single body or substance (soul) it only exists in times or places because of our memory
- Self is identical with consciousness and consciousness is accessible empirically (aware of your own perceptions and thinking)
- Even when you die you exist as a self in the memory and consciousness of other people
	- self is associated with memory and consciousness
