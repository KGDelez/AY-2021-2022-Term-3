### Socrates
- Our true self is our soul
	- not the body
	- our struggle -> discover that self
- Our soul is a thinking (reason) and willing subject
- "know thy self"; "the unexamined life is not worth living" - an individual may gain possession of oneself and be one's own master through knowledge and reason
- inward search of self knowledge is our true nature which will lead to happiness
- realm of ideas
	- perfection of self is in the realm of ideas
	- knowledge is in the realm of ideas - the transcendental world
	- we should strive to get to the realm of ideas -> to be in communion with that realm and strive for perfection
		- main goal
		- thats why examin ourselves -> lead to happiness
