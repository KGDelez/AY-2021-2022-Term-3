## Erving Goffman
### The Dramaturgical World
- We are all actors within the social world
	- Society = Theatre
	- Human = Actors
- "fakers" or "Con Job"
- "Self presentatiion" and the "role performances"
	- we play a certain role to entertain others for them to praise us
		- fake behaviour/actions
- Two Regions
	- Front Region - Fake actions; performance
	- Back Region - No audience; "real self"
