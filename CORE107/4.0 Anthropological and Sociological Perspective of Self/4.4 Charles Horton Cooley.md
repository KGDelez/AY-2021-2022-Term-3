## Charles Horton Cooley
### The Looking Glass Self - Reflections of who we are
- The knowing or defining of the self of an individual is through the process of internalizing the perceptions of how he thinks others (especially those who are significant to them) perceive him
- An individuals conception of the the responses of others towards him
- **your perceived perception of people towards you shapes who you are**

### Stages in the Looking Glass Self (LGS)
1. We Imagine how we seem to appear to others
2. We imagine how others judge us based on our perceptions fo their reactions to our presentation of self
3. How we interpret these feelings give us feeling about ourselves

- We need other people to have a concept of self.
