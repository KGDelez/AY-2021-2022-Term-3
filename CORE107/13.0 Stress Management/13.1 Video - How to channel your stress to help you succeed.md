## [How to channel your stress to help you succeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrwWvdM_Yns)
- we've all experienced stress in one way or another
- the way we experience stress is **primal**
	- from the lower level functions of the brain
	- we react before we understand what we're reacting to 
- Human brain processes patterns of energy and information to help us survive
	- sensing
	- feeling
	- thinking
- Many times what we can't see is more scary than what we can see
	- we pick up non-conscious cues from the environment 
		- obvious
			- media
			- technology
			- workload
		- subtle
			- how busy we are
			- how we rush around all the time 
			- how we pass our stress off to one another
		- we're constantly sensing that we're not safe
		- feeling that we don't have enought ime or energy or money to deal with all the demands of life
	- We try to minimize the stress and manage it
		- blaming on other people or other things
		- hide and hope it goes away
		- justify not doing anything with it (others have it worse so just let it go)
	- We're not actually doing anything with the energy and information stress provides us
		- and then we push it down and suppress it
		- and stress - which was meant to motivate action becomes **inflammation** 
			- causes wear and tear
			- can make us feel
				- sick
				- tired
			- can make us act stupid
			- can spill out to affect others around us
- Better way to navigate our experiences of stress?
	- look into it and learn from it
	- use it to fuel some sort of positive change
	- stress itself is not a problem - its the relationshp with stress that needs to be fixed
		- when too stressed, higher level capacities (like below) go offline
			- curiosity
			- creativity
			- collaboration
	- Steps:
		- take a breath and assess what's realy happening
			- understand to learn how to use it and navigate experience of stress more effectively
			- **Stress is what happens when demand exceeds capacity**
			- Stress is neither good nor bad
			- Stress is energy potential that we can use in positive r negative ways
	- Stress response (The 4Fs) but these are actually **stress reactions** (react - something that happens to us)
		- Fear
		- Fight
		- Flight
		- Freeze or Faint
	- Stress Response (ACTUAL) (response - something that happens for us - greatest asset for survival to stop and think and respond)
		- what happens when we actually stop and assess the situation then decide how we want to proceed
- Shark in the water
	- Only way to convince self to get in is when 
		- feel safe
		- and self is interested
	- **Potential cure** - Our ability to be curious
		- when shift to state of curiosity 
			- brain calms down
			- lens through whcih we see circumstances changes
			- patterns of energy and information - we see them in new ways that we can use so it can help rather than hurt us
- Stressed brain vs Curious brain
	- stress
		- starts to shut down and protect self
		- relies on survival based reactions
	- curious
		- open
		- interested
		- willing to look at new possibilities 
		- we can actually learn from our experiences
		- grow from our mistakes
- More we practice getting into state of curiosity -> more we can develop new human stress response
	- instead of fight or flight or freeze or faint
	- practice **question and consider** 
		- stop
		- ask the important questions
			- why this is
			- is this really happening right now
			- what is it that i need in this moment
		- then consider possibilities
			- how might this experience be helping me to grow stronger
			- how might the lessons im learning now help someone else in the future
	- More we practice this, the more of the below we can be
		- flexible
		- adaptable
- Use stress to fuel positive change
	- stress can actually be a blessing
