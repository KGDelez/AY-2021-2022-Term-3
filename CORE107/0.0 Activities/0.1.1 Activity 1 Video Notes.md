### How to Find Yourself in 4 Steps
#### and become who you truly want to become
1. Don't follow the herd mentality
	- What we've called universal values, what we have called truth, has always only ever been the personal expressions of those who promoted them
	- Herd Mentality
		- sameness
		- comfort
		- preservatiom of the population
		- People who are afraid of change
			- people who have amputated their creativity, dreams, and goals
			- and are insecure or even threatened by everyone that exhibits those qualities
			- Afraid of admitting to themselves that their potential has not been fully realized
	- moral code is almost the same
		- Fabricated by individuals
			- for societal control over human behavior
		- it can even become dogmatic and even make some individuals more rebellious
			- Antisocial attitudes
			- Antisocial actions
		- If moral code is flexible enough, then maybe not much force to see changes needed to happen
			- But this is often not the case. it is often very strict
			- someone who stands out too much is terrifying and dangerous
	-  leave the herd behind and shine a light so bright that it can't be ignored
		- start questioning 
		- silence the negative voices internalized when young
2. Embrace the difficulty of self-discovery 
	- **No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself**
	- Suffering is an integral part of life 
		- but instinct tells us to evade it
	-  **It is only when we are willing to face the challenges of life that we are spiritually growing**
	- **If someone wishes to be somebody in this life, to maximize their potential, they need to take the difficult path, which often leads to isolation**
		- self analysis and see what's hindering you to become who you want to be
3.  Say yes to what gives us meaning in our own lives - the things we find vaue in personally
	- can no longer turn to religion to find meaning in an increasingly secular and scientific society
		- concerning as it drives one to nihilism - apathy and unwillingness to find meaning in life
	- **3 ways to find meaning  other than religion**
		1. replace religion with philo, art, music, literature, theatre (generally the humanities)
		2. becoming an Ãœbermensch
			- superhuman that creates his own meaning and values without reference to outside influences
			- inventing own meaning and taking full responsibility for it
				- Julius Ceasar
				- Napoleon Bonapart
				- Buddha
				- Goethe
		3. Loving your life no matter what it has in it
			- the love of Fate - **Amor Fati**
				- to love your fate is to know that everything that has happened in your life, the good, the bad, and the ugly has contributed to who you are and what you are doing at this very moment
				- embracing your failures alongside the successes
				- re-spark the love of life
4.  Find your True Values
	- Create our own values to lift "The Greatest Weight"
		- the feeling that crushes you into repeating past mistakes because of the unevaluated
		- If you do not think the way you have been living is worth repeating inumerably
			-  you havent formed your own values and are still a slave to society and to yourself
			- repeating same mistakes you always have

- most of us live our lives in our self-imposed jail
- try to think of strategies out of that situation
