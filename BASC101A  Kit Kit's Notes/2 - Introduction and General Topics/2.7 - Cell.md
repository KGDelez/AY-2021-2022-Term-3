## Cell
Cell: Basic structural unit of life, capable of performing series of processes necessary for survival.

Metabolism: subtotal of physical and chemical processes that take place in a living organism
	- Catabolism (Destructive): Carbohydrate braeakdown in mitochondria to produce energy
	- Anabolism (Constructive): Syntehsis of proteins, lipids, streroids, carbohydrates in the ER. ^8aa217

### Protoplasm
- Collective term for different substances that make up a cell
	- Water: principal fluid medium constitutinng 70-85% of cell mass
	- Carbohydrates: provide most of the nutritional requirements of the cell such as glucose for energy production
	- Protein: Provide most of the structural requirements of the cell
		- may be globular or fibrous
	- Lipids/Fats: Essential for cell memberane formation and production of hormones
	- Electrolytes: Provide inorganic chemicals for cellular reactions
		- Cations (+): Na+, K+, Ca+, Mg_
		- Anions (-): Cl-, PO4-, HCO3-, SO4-

### Parts of A Cell
* Cell membrane: Principal cell barrier regulating inflow and outflow of cytoplasmic substances
* Nucleus: Brain/Main Control center of the cell
	* Nucleolus: Contains RNA
	* Chromosomes: Contains DNA
	* Nuclear Sap: Fluid component of the nucleus
	* Nuclear envelope: Limiting membrane of nucleus
* Mitochondrion (singular)/ Mitochondria (plural): boat/sausage-shaped organelle that is regarded as the powerhouse of the cell 
	* Powerhouse -> ATP through the Kreb's cycle/Tricarboxylic cycle
* Lysosome: Contains hydrolase
	*  Destroys foreign agents esp. microorganisms
* Peroxisome: Contains oxidase
	* Destroys foreign agents esp. microorganisms
* Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Protein synthesis
* Free Ribosomes: Ribosomes that are free floating in the cytoplasm - Also does protein synthesis for internal/cellular use
* Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): Steroid, lipid, and carbohydrate synthesis
* Golgi complex (Golgi apparatus): Crescent/half-moon shaped; the packaging center of the cell
* Centrioles: A pair of organnels that guide the spindle fibers during mitiosis and meiosis
* Cytoplasm: a gel like matrix with protein tubules that trap/keep organelles in place
	* Microtubules
	* Intermediate filaments
	* Active filaments
