#### Constantine's rule
- Roman emperors take an active part in religious matters (is like high priest of paganism)
- Constantine urged convocation of ==Council of Nicaea== in year 325 to help church overcome ==Arian heresy== and gave rise to ==Nicene Creed==
- Transferred capital from Rome -> Byzantim (renamed to Constantinople)
	- Rome was left free to become center of Catholic world
- ##### Prevention of Constantine's Dream of Christianizing Roman Empire
	- HIGH PRIEST - As head of Roman Empire - emperor is official high priest of pagan worship
		- had power to issue decrees suppressing pagan practices, but is not reasonable to insist on implementation
	- SUBORDINATION TO POPE - Even though Emperors became Christians, they did not easily accept the subordination of their authority to that of the Pope and the hierarchy of the Church
	- DICTATE HIERARCHY - in process of defending the faith, they tend to dictate the hierarchy in matters of faith and ==treat the Catholic Church as subservient to the state===
	- RESULT: Paganism continued to be major until Gratian became Emperor
