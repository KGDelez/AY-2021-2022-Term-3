#### Authority in the Early Church
- Christian Authority not equal to Authority that the world generally understands
- Mk10:42:44 -> Christian Authority = SERVICE
- Apostles lead early Christan Communities
- Mt. 16:18 - Peter was given a unique authority as the "head" of the Apostles
	> first Pope
- In the Holy Roman Catholic Church
	- the authority of the Pope as the head of the Church
- In the later part of the first century - 3 new types of leaders
	- Episkopos 
		- lead certain community
		- preside the eucharistic celebrations
		- guard the church against "false teachers"
		-> bishops
	- Presbyters
		- lead certain community
		- preside the eucharistic celebrations
		- guard the church against "false teachers"
		-> priests
	- Deacons
		- "helpers" or servants within the community
		- their ministries often had to do with the care for the poor and the needy
		> cannot do Eucharist as they have to be ordained to do so
> Which are priests? which are bishops??
