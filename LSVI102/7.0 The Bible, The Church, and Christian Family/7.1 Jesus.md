## What is in a name?
- every name is a symbol
- more than being a title by which someone is recognized, a name is a representation of its bearer. 
- To praise a name is to praise the person who bears it
- We go to the extent of equating name with reputation or honror
	- to preserve one's honor is to preserve one's good name
- When our Lord became man, he needed to be called by a name
	- "...and you shall name him Jesus" - Luke 1:31
