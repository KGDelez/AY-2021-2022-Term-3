## Divisions of the New Testament
### The Gospels
- though attributed to the four evangelists, were a product of the collaborative work of the early Christians who compiled their faith accounts, particularly those regarding their experiences of the Risen Lord and his message of salvation which Jesus proclained through his words and actions
- Witnesses/ Faith Accounts
- DIVISIONS
	- Matthew
	- Mark
	- Luke
	- John
- stories that you read in Matthew can also be read in Mark and Luke
- John not included in the Synaptic Gospel because it is a very theological and symbolic Gospel

### The Acts of the Apostles
- Written also by St. Luke
- Describes the life of the early church from its birrth in Jerusalem on the first **Pentecost** to its flourishing to different parts of the "Known world" through the missionary Journeys of the Apostles, particularly St. Paul of whom St. Luke was a disciple
	- Pentecost - when the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles
		- start of the Church

### The Pauline Letters
- Pauline Epistles
- writings attributed to St. Paul
	- Paul was a Jewish Rabbi - a teacher of the law
	- was totally against Christ - followed the law to the letter and didn't follow Christ
	- Until he met Christ on the way to Damascus - beggining of Paul's conversion
- Some of these were not really written by him but by Christians who used St. Paul's teachings at their source
- These letters contain teachings, instruction, exhortations, and admonitions that are addressed to particular persons or Christian Communities
- DIVISIONS
	- Genuine Writings of Paul (all except Philemon (a person) were communities of people)
		- 1 Thessalonians
		- Galatians
		- Philippians
		- 1 Corinthians
		- 2 Corinthians
		- Romans 
		- Philemon
	- Doubtfully Genuine Writings of Paul
		- 2 Thessalonians
		- Colossians
		- Ephesians
	- Not Written by Paul
		- Titus
		- 1 Timothy
		- 2 Timothy
		- Hebrews

### Catholic Epistles
- "Catholic" means "unviersal".. The contents of these letters are more or less similar in nature to the Pauline Epistles. The difference is that these letters are all addressed to **all Christians**, unlike the Pauline letters which are addressd to particular communities
- DIVISIONS
	- James
	- 1 and 2 Peter
	- 1, 2, and 3 John (The Beloved Disciple) - different from John who wrote the Gospel
	- Jude

### Revelation (Apocalypse)
- Attributed to St. John the Gospel writer (though this is contested that it is not John the Apostle)
- Book also called "Apocalypse" since it is a visionary book containing a lot of mystical revelations
- written around 90 A.D
- Reaffirms Christianity's hope for an immediate transformation of the world, the destruction of all evil and the establishment of Christ's reign
