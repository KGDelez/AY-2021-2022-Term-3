## The Filipino Catholic
- The Catechism for Filipino Catholics (CFC) describes the following characteristics of the Filipino Catholic
	- Family Oriented
	- Meal-Oriented
	- "Kundiman" Oriented
	- "Bayani" Oriented
	- Spirit-Oriented

- ### Family Oriented
	- Draw sense of self-identity from our families
	- families provide us with a sense of security, stability, and belongingness
	- Relation to Faith
		- "Hindi siya iba sa atin."
		- Christ is our "kapatid", and because of this, we deem ourselves worth to call God "Ama Namin" and our Lady as "Mahal na Ina"

- ### Meal Oriented
	- "salo-salo" is more than just nourishment of the body
	- strengthen our relationships by sharing a meal
	- Filipino "handaan" is an expression of our good will
		- 	meals are always part of Filipino Lives
	- Relation to Faith
		- The Eucharist is our "salo-salo" 
			- family reunion
			- Christ is our "tinapay ng buhay"
			- the Host that throws a "piging" as the sign of his gracious love - love that sustains us, love that makes us one as God's people
		> Corpus Christi
			- Christ as the "bread of life" in tagalog

- ### Kundiman-oriented
	- The "kundiman" is a sad love song
	- We are naturally attracted to those who are "kawawa" or "kinakawawa"
	- We are also very patient and forgiving "alang-alang sa pinagsamahan"
		- but should have boundaries
	- We are willing to suffer for the sake of others
	- Relation to Faith:
		- Christ is the God who keeps on loving us to the point of suffering and death
		- "Pinagmalasakitan tayo"
		- In him, we find someone who understands our struggles and heartaches for he himself has been througgh it all

- ### Bayani Oriented
	- We look up to heros
	- admire people who give up their lives for our sake
	- do not want sad endings to our stories
	- perhaps we endure suffering because there is someone who is willing to sacrifice on our behalf to defend us from oppressors and get us out of our misery
		- Why we like superheroes
	- Relation to Faith:
		- Jesus is our "Christo Rey", 
			- the King who is "tagapagtanggol ng inaapi"
			- "kampon ng masa"
		- He is the defender of the poor and the oppressed
		- As king, he assures us that things will go well since he has already triumphed over evil
		> Christ the King Feast
		> 	next day is the first day of Advent

- ### Spirit Oriented
	- For us Filipinos, the "supernatural" is natural
	- We likely believe the existence of the invisible and the mysterious
	- Relation to Faith:
		- Easy for us to accept Jesus as a miracle worker
			- "mapaghimala"
			- "Makapanyarihan sa lahat"
		- He can exorcize demons, heal diseases, control nature
