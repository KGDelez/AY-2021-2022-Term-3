## What would Jesus do?
- Faced with many problems and issues that challenge us
- Ask "WWJD"
- The way of Christ should be our way
- if we follow christ, we shall overcome the turbulent storms of this world

## Tell the World of His Love
- When Pope John Paul II visited us in 1995, he sent us, the youth, on a mission 
	- same mission christ gave his apostles
	- "As the Father has sent me, so I send you"
- We are not mere beneficiaries of the Good News, we are also **agents**
- We commit ourselves to illumine the world with the light of Christ which we bear
- Jesus loves us, we can't help but tell the world of His Love
