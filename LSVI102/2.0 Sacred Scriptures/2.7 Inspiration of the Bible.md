	- the presence of the holy spirit
	- "By supernatural power God so moved and impelled the human authrs to write - he so assisted them when writing - that the things he ordered and those only they first rightly understood, then willed faithfully to write down, and finally expressed in apt words and with infalliable truth"
	- Providentissimus Deus, Pope Leo XIII
		- Inspiration is the special influence of the Holy Spirit on the Human Authors, such as they were able to write down what God wanted them to write
- Not dictation nor possession

### Written by Men through the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit
- The bible did not fall from heaven
- When God gave us his word, he inspired some men to put it into writing
- The Bible was written by persons who lived in a particular context, using the means available to them as they went through the natural process of data gathering, selection, and finally writing down scriptures
- Because the Bible was written by men, then through the Bible God is able to speak to us in human language - something we can understand and relate to
- "All scripture, inspired by God (missing)"
