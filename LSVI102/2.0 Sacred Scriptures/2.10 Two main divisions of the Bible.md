## Two Main Divisions of the Bible
- Old Testament (OT)
	- Covenant between God and Israel mediated by Moses
	- Central Event: The exodus
	- Largely Hebrew
- New Testament (NT)
	- Covenant between God and Humanity mediated by Jesus
	- Central Event: The resurrection
	- Largely Greek (?)
- The old testament finds light in the new testament and the NT finds foundation in the OT.
- The church teaches that both divisions are equally inspired
