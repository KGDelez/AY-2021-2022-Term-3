- ### The Church as an Institution
	- The Church as a visible, hierarchical structure, with a strong emphasis on authority and power of its officers
	- #### Hierarchicial-Structured Society
		- Has a form of government and leaders
		- conceived not as a democratic or representative society, but as one in which the **fullness of power is entrusted to ordained ministers**
			- went through ordination/process of becoming ordained

		- Order
			- Pope - head of church and head of state
			- Cardinal - post given by the church (can be nominated as pope)
			- Archbishops and bishops - one is in the metropolitan dioceses
			- Priests - clergy or religious (in the parishes)
			- Laity - US
		- Hebrew 13:17
			- Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls and will give you an account. Let them do it with joy and not with sighing - for that would be harmful for you.
			- Have to listen and follow our leaders - not just in government but also in the Church
			- Admister sacraments (everything above the Laity)
		- ##### Authority as Service
			- Jesus provides model of an authority. He shares his authority with his disciples
			- The structures of the Church must be seen as subordinate to its communal life and mission
		- ##### Limitation
			- The model identifies the Church with the Kingdom of God on earth
			- At the expense of the abiding need or renewal and reform not just of its individual members but of the whole church
			- Thats why priests have retreats and reformation seminars (Renewal and Reform)
				- attend retreats
