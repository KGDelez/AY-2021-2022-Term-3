## Marks of the Church
- refer to 4 inseparable aspects that are intrinsic to the true church
- Our Lord Himself in founding the Church, marked it with these characteristics, which reflect its essential features and mission
- Alluded in the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch but dogmatically defined during the 381 Council of Constantinople and was inserted into the symbol of faith
- ### The Chruch is ONE
	- there is only one Christian Chruch which is united in faith, in worshin and in succession from the apostles themselves
			> Bishop - successor of aposltes
		- The Church is the Body of Christ Himself and so is whole and one as Christ's body is whole and one
	- "The Church is one"
		- acknowledges one Lord
		- confesses one faith
		- is born of one baptism
		- forms only one Body
		- given life by one Spirit
		- for the sake of one hope
		- at whose fulfillment all divisions will be overcome
	- All these separated from the Catholic church remain part of her, in a mysterious way
		- All those who receive Christian baptisim belong to the Catholic Church 
			> as long as its a trinitarian baptism it is valid to Catholic Church
			> Acknowledge for Catholics that the pope is the head
			
	- ### The Church si Holy
		- the most Holy god is her author
		- Christ - bridegroom
			- gave himself up to make her holy
			- the Spirit of holiness gives her life
		- Church
			- perfect and holy
			- the spotless bride of Christ
			- the undefiled Body of Christ himself, filled with the Holy Spirit
		- Does not mean that the members of the church are free from sin
			- neither than that the institution of the Church cannot commit sin
			- Since the Crurch still includes sinners, she is
				- "the sinless one made up of sinners"
				> composed of saints and sinners
				> Christ body and Holy Spirit
				
				- Her Holiness shines in the saints - in Mary she is already all-holy
				- The mysterious paradox is that the Churhc is holy and perfect even though she is made of imperfect sinners!
	> celebration of sacraments
	> 	Church continues the mission of Jesus
